# Monero Localization Workgroup
The Monero localization Workgroup takes care of the internationalization of all things Monero. Basically, **we are the folks who make sure all the tools, wallets, documentation and website are translated in as many languages as possible**, so that more and more people can use Monero and take part in this revolution. *This workgroup is one of the oldest and more active in the Monero Community*.

At the moment we manage the internationalization of:

- The [Monero GUI wallet](https://github.com/monero-project/monero-gui)
- The [Monero CLI wallet](https://github.com/monero-project/monero)
- The documents of the [Outreach workgroup](https://github.com/monero-ecosystem/outreach-docs)
- [Monerujo](https://github.com/m2049r/xmrwallet)
- The [guide for the GUI wallet](https://github.com/monero-ecosystem/monero-GUI-guide) (after it's released)
- The [Monero website](https://repo.getmonero.org/monero-project/monero-site) (getmonero.org)
- Other minor projects like the ['Don't buy monero' sticker](https://github.com/monero-ecosystem/dont-buy-monero-sticker) or the projects [listed on Taiga](https://taiga.getmonero.org/project/erciccione-monero-localization/backlog)

If you wish to help with translations, best is to contact the Localization Workgroup, so to have an idea of what are the priorities at the moment, you can find a list of contacts at the bottom of this readme. If you prefer, you can **directly start working on some projects** (like the Monero GUI and CLI wallets) by yourself. Thanks to our Localization Platform (Weblate), translators aren't required any particular technical skill: Just sign in, look for your language and translate the missing strings!
 
If you need help with Weblate, no problem! Just **take a look at the guide in the list below**, it will guide you step-by-step. If something is not clear, just **contact us and we will be happy to help!**.

## Terminology guides
These are glossaries created by the members of the Localization workgroup. **They help translators to find the best translation for technical terms**. They also help to keep translations consistent between different projects. *These trminology guides will be soon replaced by a traslation memory software*.  
The glossaries are available for these languages:

  - [French](https://github.com/monero-ecosystem/monero-translations/blob/master/terminology-guides/french-terminology.md)
  - [German](https://github.com/monero-ecosystem/monero-translations/blob/master/terminology-guides/german-terminology.md)
