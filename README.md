# Monero Localization Workgroup

The Monero Localization Workgroup takes care of the internationalization of all things Monero. Basically, **we are the folks who make sure all the tools, wallets, documentation and website are translated in as many languages as possible**. The goal is that through localization, more and more people can use Monero and take part in this revolution.

*This workgroup is the oldest community-run workgroup in the Monero Community*.

## Repository

This repository stores documents, guides and discussions related to translation efforts within the Monero Community. Feel free to suggest new materials [opening an issue](https://github.com/monero-ecosystem/monero-translations/issues/new).

For coordination, updates and announcements it is strongly suggested to join the chat `#monero-translations`. More info in the **Contacts** section at the end of the file.

## Getting Started

Most of the Monero content can be translated using our Weblate instance. Below you can find the many projects and resources that are coordinated by this workgroup.

There is not a complete list of projects we work on. We are just a group of individuals who coordinate to provide high quality translations and to give guidelines and support to other translators.

If you wish to help with translations, the best you can do is to contact the Localization Workgroup using the chat provided in the **Contacts** section to have an idea of what are the priorities at the moment. If you prefer, you can **directly start working on some projects** (like the [Monero GUI and CLI wallets](https://translate.getmonero.org/engage/monero/)) by yourself. Thanks to our Localization Platform, translators are not required to have any particular technical skill. Just visit Weblate, search for your language and translate the missing strings!

> Having an account on Weblate is not mandatory to submit translations, but it is recommended to register so that you will benefit from its features.

With an account, you will be able to:

- Track your submissions;
- Get credited when translations are pushed upstream (that is, they are added to the applications and website);
- Link your GitHub and GitLab accounts;
- Manage your profile and much more.
 
If you need help with Weblate, no problem! Just **take a look at the guides in the list above**. If something is not clear, just **contact us and we will be happy to help!**
