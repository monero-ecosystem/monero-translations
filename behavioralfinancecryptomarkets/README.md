**Behavioral Finance, Cryptocurrency Markets** is a keynote presentation originally livestreamed as part of the TCV Summit crypto conference, held February 4-5, 2021.  In this lecture, Dr. Daniel Kim weaves together award-winning research from academic finance with case studies from both the legacy financial and cryptocurrency markets to examine the degree to which cryptocurrency markets achieve efficient price discovery -- a timely topic at a time in which the discrepancy between Monero's fundamental merits and its market capitalization was significant.  The presentation was released for free public viewing on February 14, 2021 at [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REC5V7d3pqM).
