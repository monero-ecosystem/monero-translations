1
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:57,279
I know it's been a long day for everyone

2
00:00:57,280 --> 00:00:59,679
and looking over the chat

3
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:02,238
it's a bit of a tough crowd, and I will

4
00:01:02,239 --> 00:01:03,759
do my best to

5
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:05,599
present some new results --

6
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:07,118
this is actually the first time I will be

7
00:01:07,119 --> 00:01:09,199
presenting this particular talk

8
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:11,999
and I hope it will be of practical

9
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,359
benefit to you, while

10
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:15,839
being not just one guy's opinion,

11
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:17,998
but based in academic research.

12
00:01:17,999 --> 00:01:19,359
As Rafael mentioned,

13
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:20,798
I'm the Founder and CEO of Sweetwater

14
00:01:20,799 --> 00:01:22,239
Digital Asset Consulting.

15
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:24,239
I see myself as bridging two very

16
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:25,438
separate worlds

17
00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:27,919
which know very little about each other,

18
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:31,359
and, in fact, often times have little but

19
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:33,118
stereotype and prejudice to

20
00:01:33,119 --> 00:01:35,679
cast the other in.  Those two worlds are

21
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:38,719
that of cypherpunk, cryptocurrency, open source

22
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:41,239
projects such as Monero or Bitcoin,

23
00:01:41,240 --> 00:01:43,818
and then on the other side of this bridge,

24
00:01:43,819 --> 00:01:47,199
is the traditional finance world, so as

25
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:48,798
Rafael mentioned, I was head of research

26
00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:50,559
at a hedge fund and

27
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:53,279
so that is what I prepared my remarks to

28
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:55,758
to cover today.

29
00:01:55,759 --> 00:01:58,639
Here's a taxonomy of assets.  These are

30
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:00,158
all the things that are out there that

31
00:02:00,159 --> 00:02:02,078
are possible to invest in for

32
00:02:02,079 --> 00:02:05,118
those who have wealth to invest.

33
00:02:05,119 --> 00:02:07,519
And I’m dividing this into two rows:

34
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:10,182
there's fungible and non-fungible.

35
00:02:10,184 --> 00:02:11,679
So, roughly, fungible means

36
00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:15,279
that you don't care which thing you get

37
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:17,679
because from your point of view, all the

38
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:19,039
things that you could get are all

39
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:21,439
the same.  So if you look the fungible

40
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:22,799
bottom row here, we're looking at

41
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:25,199
cash and precious metals, so if you have

42
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:27,759
gold you can always melt it down.

43
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:29,598
There's no history associated with any

44
00:02:29,599 --> 00:02:31,199
piece of gold, and so

45
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:32,479
from your point of view as long as you

46
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:33,919
know that something is gold, you don't

47
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:36,110
care where it came from.  Gold is gold.

48
00:02:36,112 --> 00:02:38,079
It's fungible.

49
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:41,199
In the decentralized world, the

50
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:43,119
leader in that market segment is

51
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:44,479
currently Monero.

52
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:46,399
There's also non-fungible, which is on

53
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:47,839
the top, and that is,

54
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:50,639
you do care which particular unit of

55
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:51,919
value that you're getting,

56
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:53,931
because they're not the same.

57
00:02:53,933 --> 00:02:55,919
So, let's think about real estate or

58
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:58,479
artworks.  If you have a plot of land,

59
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:00,479
there's presumably reasons that you

60
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:02,158
chose that plot of land,

61
00:03:02,159 --> 00:03:04,639
and it's not really cool for you to just

62
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:05,598
get whatever

63
00:03:05,599 --> 00:03:07,359
plot of land that comes out of some grab

64
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:08,719
bag or something.

65
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:11,039
Land is not fungible.  And it's the same

66
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:12,639
with works of art.

67
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:16,158
So, Bitcoin falls in that category, in that

68
00:03:16,159 --> 00:03:18,799
there's a record -- a digital record -- that

69
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:21,039
is really etched in stone,

70
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:23,679
of everybody who had a piece of that

71
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:25,518
value in the Bitcoin blockchain

72
00:03:25,519 --> 00:03:28,878
before you did.  And so, for people who

73
00:03:28,879 --> 00:03:31,119
have a squeaky clean reputation,

74
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:32,878
who have worked hard, played by the rules

75
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:34,798
their whole life --

76
00:03:34,799 --> 00:03:37,598
they want to be insulated from the

77
00:03:37,599 --> 00:03:39,839
potential misdeeds of other people who

78
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:41,679
are on that same network.

79
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:43,679
Which means that Bitcoin is going to

80
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:45,199
fail these people.

81
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:46,639
Bitcoin is going to fail these people

82
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:48,878
because sometimes, these squeaky clean

83
00:03:48,879 --> 00:03:50,318
people are going to deal with

84
00:03:50,319 --> 00:03:52,238
other people on the Bitcoin blockchain

85
00:03:52,239 --> 00:03:54,639
who are not as squeaky clean as they are.

86
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:57,759
And because in a surveillance coin --

87
00:03:57,760 --> 00:04:00,399
a transparent coin like Bitcoin --

88
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:03,438
reputation transfers as well as value,

89
00:04:03,439 --> 00:04:04,798
that means that the squeaky clean

90
00:04:04,799 --> 00:04:06,798
person's reputation is going to be

91
00:04:06,799 --> 00:04:08,479
besmirched,

92
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:11,199
by chance -- by having done some sort of

93
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:14,079
random financial transaction with someone on

94
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:15,759
the Bitcoin blockchain who's not as squeaky

95
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:16,798
clean as they are.

96
00:04:16,799 --> 00:04:19,518
So a classic example would be: a squeaky

97
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:21,119
clean person has a car,

98
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:23,679
and they sell it to somebody for bitcoin,

99
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:25,599
and unbeknownst to them,

100
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:27,839
the person who they sold their car to

101
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:29,039
got their bitcoin

102
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:31,359
by dealing on the dark web, or some

103
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:34,079
nefarious activity.

104
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:37,198
So, it's a bit counterintuitive,

105
00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:39,039
but the conclusion of this -- and this is

106
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:40,719
also supported by some

107
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:42,959
Nobel prize winning research in

108
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:44,959
economics, for example, the Akerloff

109
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:46,319
paper which studies [the]

110
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:48,719
behavior of participants in a market

111
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:50,638
when buyers and sellers have

112
00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:53,119
different levels of information on

113
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:54,959
what's being traded --

114
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:56,559
the conclusion of that is that the

115
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:58,239
squeaky clean people are going to leave

116
00:04:58,240 --> 00:04:59,279
that market,

117
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:01,758
in which their goodness, basically, is not

118
00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:03,359
compensated for.

119
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:05,599
And they are going to go to a coin that

120
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:09,836
will protect them, like Monero.

121
00:05:09,838 --> 00:05:12,239
But let's step back for a minute.  Let's talk

122
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:15,038
about fiat currency and scarcity in

123
00:05:15,039 --> 00:05:16,799
general, and why is it that we even care

124
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:18,959
about cryptocurrency to start with.

125
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:21,758
The G20 is the collection of 20 of the

126
00:05:21,759 --> 00:05:23,599
largest world economies.

127
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:25,918
What I’m showing here is the amount of

128
00:05:25,919 --> 00:05:28,239
money supply that each of these countries

129
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:31,839
has out in circulation.  The left-hand

130
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:33,999
side of this plot is 2009, which is the

131
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,719
year that Bitcoin became a thing,

132
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:39,038
and this goes all the way to data that I

133
00:05:39,039 --> 00:05:41,599
collected just a couple of days ago from the

134
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:43,999
Federal Reserve website.

135
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,239
And what I've done is that no matter how

136
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:47,679
big or how small

137
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:50,959
any country's currency is, they [are]

138
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:53,758
labeled as having a value of 1 at the

139
00:05:53,759 --> 00:05:55,679
beginning of 2020.

140
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:57,758
And so what you can see is that every

141
00:05:57,759 --> 00:05:58,799
fiat currency

142
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:00,478
in the world turned on the printing

143
00:06:00,479 --> 00:06:03,359
presses at an accelerating rate

144
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:05,421
after the pandemic hit.

145
00:06:05,423 --> 00:06:07,198
Before the pandemic,

146
00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:09,758
there was even still reason for quite a

147
00:06:09,759 --> 00:06:12,478
bit of concern because if you look,

148
00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:15,679
this is 0.5 here, which means that in the

149
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:17,439
time period between 2012

150
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:20,559
and 2020, that eight year period, that's

151
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:22,478
a doubling of most countries'

152
00:06:22,479 --> 00:06:25,599
fiat supplies.  If something doubles every

153
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:26,959
eight years,

154
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:29,119
then think about what the impact of that

155
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:31,359
is over your lifetime.  So, let's say the

156
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:32,399
average person

157
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:35,038
lives 80 years, then this doubling is

158
00:06:35,039 --> 00:06:37,029
going to happen 10 times,

159
00:06:37,031 --> 00:06:38,478
and when something doubles

160
00:06:38,479 --> 00:06:40,478
a bunch of times, it gets big fast.  That's

161
00:06:40,479 --> 00:06:42,318
exponential growth.  In this case, it would

162
00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:44,478
be 2 to the 10th power, which is about

163
00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:47,519
1,000.  So that's a 1,000 times

164
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:50,799
inflation in the money supply over one's

165
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:51,439
lifetime --

166
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:53,839
and that is using the rate of growth

167
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:55,679
before the pandemic.

168
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:57,918
After the pandemic we're looking at a

169
00:06:57,919 --> 00:06:59,359
doubling time that's closer to

170
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:02,239
maybe two years.  The reason that it's

171
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:03,279
disguised a bit,

172
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:05,198
is that everybody else is doing it too.

173
00:07:05,199 --> 00:07:07,198
So, if everyone else is doing it, then

174
00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:09,038
we don't look quite as bad on a relative

175
00:07:09,039 --> 00:07:11,758
basis with other countries.

176
00:07:11,759 --> 00:07:14,159
However, since 2009, there has been such a

177
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:16,079
thing as decentralized scarcity.  There

178
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:19,359
has been a thing called Bitcoin, which

179
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:20,995
manufactured a way

180
00:07:20,997 --> 00:07:22,959
to synthesize digital scarcity

181
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:25,403
without needing a central authority

182
00:07:25,405 --> 00:07:27,758
to maintain that scarcity.

183
00:07:27,759 --> 00:07:29,279
What I’m showing here is year-over-year

184
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:31,198
supply inflation.

185
00:07:31,199 --> 00:07:34,239
In green, you're looking at how much

186
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:36,799
USD was there in one year versus the

187
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:37,839
year previous,

188
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:39,839
and I’m looking at MZM, which is a broad

189
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:41,839
measure of money supply which includes

190
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:43,439
checking, savings accounts, and money

191
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:45,198
market accounts --

192
00:07:45,199 --> 00:07:46,878
there is a multiplier effect here if you

193
00:07:46,879 --> 00:07:48,638
want to get technical -- but you know,

194
00:07:48,639 --> 00:07:50,159
at the end of the day, all of these

195
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:51,918
measures of money supply show the same

196
00:07:51,919 --> 00:07:55,279
thing:  there's a giant spike at the pandemic

197
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:59,598
and the giant spike has not gone away.

198
00:07:59,599 --> 00:08:01,758
In contrast to that, let's look at these

199
00:08:01,759 --> 00:08:03,918
alternate forms of scarcity that are not

200
00:08:03,919 --> 00:08:05,758
controlled by a central government -- the

201
00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:07,359
classic one being gold.

202
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:09,119
Now the World Gold Council does an

203
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:11,198
estimate of how much gold

204
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:13,150
is being dug out of the ground every year.

205
00:08:13,152 --> 00:08:15,359
It's been inflating at about 1.8 percent

206
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:16,478
per year, and that's been pretty

207
00:08:16,479 --> 00:08:19,597
consistent over the last 10 years, at least.

208
00:08:19,599 --> 00:08:22,239
So now, let's plot against that the

209
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:24,159
corresponding inflation figures for

210
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:26,478
Bitcoin and Monero.  The thing with

211
00:08:26,479 --> 00:08:28,559
cryptocurrencies is,

212
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:31,918
unlike even gold, it can be predicted

213
00:08:31,919 --> 00:08:34,639
in advance what the inflation rate is

214
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:37,199
going to be in the supply of that currency.

215
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:38,958
So this is one of the big features of

216
00:08:38,959 --> 00:08:40,718
cryptocurrency, is that

217
00:08:40,719 --> 00:08:43,679
the [rate] of future coin emissions has been

218
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:45,518
programmed in advance,

219
00:08:45,519 --> 00:08:47,919
and it's enforced by the entire network

220
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:49,039
of computers

221
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:51,119
that is helping to do the bookkeeping

222
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:53,199
for each respective network.

223
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:55,599
So, Bitcoin computers have programmed [in]

224
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:58,239
them this future inflation curve,

225
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:00,639
and the same with Monero.  And you can see

226
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:01,518
that we're coming in

227
00:09:01,519 --> 00:09:03,128
on this inflection point here.

228
00:09:03,130 --> 00:09:05,039
In mid-2021,

229
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:06,639
the rate of year-over-year supply

230
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:08,479
inflation is going to

231
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:10,258
cross that of gold,

232
00:09:10,260 --> 00:09:12,606
and go [lower than] that of gold, and it will

233
00:09:12,608 --> 00:09:16,238
remain lower than that of gold, forever.

234
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:18,639
Now in the Monero project, of course, as

235
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:20,639
you've heard all day, the big

236
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:23,359
kind of uniting ethos of the Monero

237
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:25,599
community is we want this form of scarce

238
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:27,359
value to be fungible.

239
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:29,759
In other words, it introduces all sorts

240
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:32,239
of "meatspace" level problems -- this is

241
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:34,479
social level problems --

242
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:37,679
when a source of value is completely

243
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:40,239
traceable.  First of all, it [invites] the

244
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:42,079
participation of these so-called chain

245
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:43,359
analysis companies,

246
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:45,679
whose job it is to try to analyze the

247
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:47,119
flow of funds

248
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:49,679
in a transparent chain, and basically

249
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:51,119
"dox" people.

250
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:53,119
But the thing is, they have incomplete

251
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:55,518
information of the economic activity on

252
00:09:55,519 --> 00:09:56,707
the chain.

253
00:09:56,709 --> 00:09:58,398
All they can see is that money

254
00:09:58,399 --> 00:10:00,479
changed hands from person A to person B.

255
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:03,444
they have no knowledge of the context --

256
00:10:03,446 --> 00:10:05,720
which means it's easy for them to come to

257
00:10:05,722 --> 00:10:08,159
false conclusions.  So let's go back to that

258
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:09,359
example of the

259
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:11,439
car seller.  Somebody sells their car for

260
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:13,359
bitcoin, they receive bitcoin that came

261
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:15,919
from a drug dealer or some bad person.

262
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:17,759
Now the innocent person who sold their

263
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:19,518
car has a problem,

264
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:21,838
because these chain analysis people know

265
00:10:21,839 --> 00:10:24,398
that a quote-unquote bad person supplied

266
00:10:24,399 --> 00:10:27,039
the bitcoin that this innocent car seller

267
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:28,479
now has.

268
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:30,239
So now, when this innocent car seller

269
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:32,078
goes to put their bitcoin on an exchange

270
00:10:32,079 --> 00:10:34,479
to sell it back for USD, they're going to

271
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:35,439
get flagged,

272
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:37,838
and be forced to defend themselves

273
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:39,741
against these accusations

274
00:10:39,743 --> 00:10:41,359
that were made on incomplete,

275
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:46,479
partial information, by a third party, who is

276
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:49,196
looking at this blockchain data from afar,

277
00:10:49,198 --> 00:10:53,039
and applying, basically, a social credit score

278
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:55,278
to every participant on that network,

279
00:10:55,279 --> 00:10:57,278
providing that social credit score

280
00:10:57,279 --> 00:10:58,319
to its customers,

281
00:10:58,320 --> 00:10:59,518
which are going to be things like

282
00:10:59,519 --> 00:11:01,319
exchanges, and so on --

283
00:11:01,321 --> 00:11:03,359
and they're going to wash their hands of any

284
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:04,958
inaccuracies.  They'll say, "well, we did our

285
00:11:04,959 --> 00:11:09,359
best -- we came up with a 72.3 percent

286
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:11,518
chance that this person was actually bad

287
00:11:11,519 --> 00:11:14,078
and so, you know, if if that turns out to be

288
00:11:14,079 --> 00:11:16,639
wrong, well, then, you know, sorry" --

289
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:19,199
but really they're not really that sorry

290
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:20,958
and the people who they are

291
00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:23,278
surveilling and making these social

292
00:11:23,279 --> 00:11:24,398
credit scores for,

293
00:11:24,399 --> 00:11:27,439
have no recourse to clear up their name

294
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:29,505
in case they're falsely accused.

295
00:11:29,507 --> 00:11:33,999
So again, in Monero, the ethos is

296
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:37,119
that the best solution

297
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:39,199
for humanity's needs is going to be a

298
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:40,799
fungible coin.

299
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:42,639
And it turns out that this is easier

300
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:43,999
said than done, because

301
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,319
digital assets have at their heart

302
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:47,919
strings of ones and zeros

303
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:51,119
which are obviously unique.  You can tell

304
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:52,719
one string of ones and zeros from

305
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:54,479
another string of ones and zeros.

306
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:57,919
And so, to effectively manufacture

307
00:11:57,920 --> 00:12:01,438
fungibility out of something that is inherently

308
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:03,759
extremely easy to tell apart from one

309
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:05,999
another, that is, numbers --

310
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,807
it takes considerable ingenuity.

311
00:12:08,809 --> 00:12:10,799
And it is not something that can just be

312
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:12,559
slapped on.  And so

313
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:14,159
what I’m showing in this chart here, in

314
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:17,039
the top, is the daily average bytes

315
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:19,599
per transaction that is taken up on the

316
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:20,958
Monero blockchain.

317
00:12:20,959 --> 00:12:24,559
So this is how much disk space is taken up

318
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:26,479
when one person in Monero decides to

319
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:28,319
send Monero to somebody else

320
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:30,159
and you can see that it's gone through

321
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:31,359
some history here.

322
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:34,398
There was a innovation in

323
00:12:34,399 --> 00:12:38,159
Monero called RingCT which sought to

324
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:40,638
keep confidential the amounts that are

325
00:12:40,639 --> 00:12:43,199
sent between the sender and receiver

326
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:46,559
and even though this innovation caused

327
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:49,599
the size of transactions to go up over

328
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:51,359
an order of magnitude, the community

329
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:53,759
decided it was worth it to do it

330
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:55,599
then later on there was bulletproofs, which

331
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:57,599
is basically clever mathematics

332
00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:00,078
which found that, oh, these cryptographic

333
00:13:00,079 --> 00:13:01,759
proofs that we're using

334
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:05,599
to guarantee [the] integrity of the Monero system

335
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:07,359
while preserving the privacy of the

336
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:08,799
amounts transacted --

337
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:10,398
gee, there's a new way we can do that

338
00:13:10,399 --> 00:13:12,239
that takes up a lot less byte space than

339
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:13,119
it used to.

340
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:15,599
That went through an audit process, and

341
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:18,923
after that came back, it was implemented.

342
00:13:18,925 --> 00:13:20,479
And then you can see that the

343
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:22,347
transaction size went back down.

344
00:13:22,349 --> 00:13:24,551
Now, last Halloween,

345
00:13:24,552 --> 00:13:26,943
there was a new innovation [called] CLSAGs

346
00:13:26,945 --> 00:13:28,239
that also went in, and that chipped

347
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:30,638
away at the transaction size a bit more.

348
00:13:30,639 --> 00:13:33,278
The point being, that this community has

349
00:13:33,279 --> 00:13:34,719
done what it takes

350
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:37,838
to make sure that fungibility is

351
00:13:37,839 --> 00:13:39,999
in the blockchain, and improved in the

352
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,759
blockchain.  And there's continual

353
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:44,319
research happening on this front.

354
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:45,919
On the bottom we're looking at the daily

355
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:48,398
average transaction fee, in US dollars,

356
00:13:48,399 --> 00:13:50,559
for both Bitcoin and Monero.  And you can

357
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:52,398
see that when bulletproofs went in at

358
00:13:52,399 --> 00:13:54,078
the end of 2018,

359
00:13:54,079 --> 00:13:56,479
not only did the transaction size drop

360
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:58,239
by [an] order of magnitude,

361
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:01,518
the transaction fee also dropped by

362
00:14:01,519 --> 00:14:05,198
basically the same amount, and so today, to

363
00:14:05,199 --> 00:14:07,518
make a transaction in Monero, the average

364
00:14:07,519 --> 00:14:09,679
transaction [fee] is on the order of pennies,

365
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:12,398
US pennies.  And the median is actually

366
00:14:12,399 --> 00:14:14,078
below one penny.

367
00:14:14,079 --> 00:14:15,999
This is a chain that puts a high

368
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,879
priority on the needs of its users.

369
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:21,679
It's a "customer first" sort of mentality,

370
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:23,518
so, the thinking is that the users of

371
00:14:23,519 --> 00:14:25,119
Monero might be people in

372
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:28,239
oppressive regimes who are trying to escape

373
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:31,278
a draconian, cruel government with their

374
00:14:31,279 --> 00:14:33,039
lives and their life savings --

375
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:35,599
and they might need something to escape

376
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:38,933
that is truly fungible and not traceable.

377
00:14:38,935 --> 00:14:40,239
It's people like that

378
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:45,916
who the developers are developing Monero for.

379
00:14:45,918 --> 00:14:47,328
All right.  So, that

380
00:14:47,330 --> 00:14:49,119
was a very quick summary of some of

381
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:51,198
my previous videos.

382
00:14:51,199 --> 00:14:53,439
Anyone who starts from zero, and watches

383
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:54,799
these videos,

384
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:57,359
will be more informed than, I would say,

385
00:14:57,360 --> 00:14:59,577
80 percent of the other people

386
00:14:59,579 --> 00:15:01,837
who are dabbling [in cryptocurrency.]

387
00:15:01,839 --> 00:15:03,243
The names of these videos are

388
00:15:03,245 --> 00:15:05,439
"Monero:  Sound Money, Safe Mode"

389
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:06,958
and the one preceding that was called

390
00:15:06,959 --> 00:15:09,198
"Monero Means Money."

391
00:15:09,199 --> 00:15:11,359
I think it's quite rare for videos like

392
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:13,797
this to get [a] good reception,

393
00:15:13,799 --> 00:15:15,838
both from developer types

394
00:15:15,839 --> 00:15:18,559
for technical accuracy, as well as

395
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:21,278
non-technical types who appreciate the

396
00:15:21,279 --> 00:15:23,919
clarity of the explanations.  These are

397
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:24,719
something I've worked

398
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:26,814
quite hard on and I don't mean to

399
00:15:26,816 --> 00:15:28,398
really self-promote

400
00:15:28,399 --> 00:15:31,039
but this is a recommendation, because in

401
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:32,879
the chat, I saw that there were

402
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:35,439
quite a few new people who could use a

403
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:36,479
kind of a solid

404
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:40,146
background level introduction to this stuff.

405
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:42,398
Volunteers in the Monero community have

406
00:15:42,399 --> 00:15:44,078
graciously taken time to

407
00:15:44,079 --> 00:15:46,017
translate the subtitles in this.

408
00:15:46,019 --> 00:15:47,439
These videos have been,

409
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:48,879
or are in the process of being,

410
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:51,998
translated into several European languages.

411
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:55,278
Basically, we want this narrative that

412
00:15:55,279 --> 00:15:57,758
fungibility and privacy in Monero is for

413
00:15:57,759 --> 00:15:59,278
squeaky clean people too --

414
00:15:59,279 --> 00:16:01,526
they are the ones who need it most.

415
00:16:01,528 --> 00:16:03,095
And so, if that message is

416
00:16:03,097 --> 00:16:05,119
is absent in any given [society],

417
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:06,559
you might have a tendency

418
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:09,838
for regulators to assume that

419
00:16:09,839 --> 00:16:11,439
there are no squeaky clean people using

420
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:12,958
Monero, and we want to

421
00:16:12,959 --> 00:16:14,434
avoid that misperception.

422
00:16:14,436 --> 00:16:17,839
Because it is a misperception.

423
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:21,198
All right.  So now on to the new content

424
00:16:21,199 --> 00:16:22,398
of this talk.  So

425
00:16:22,399 --> 00:16:25,439
one thing you will hear, especially from

426
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:28,799
proponents of the number one market cap

427
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:29,919
crypto currently,

428
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:31,838
that is, Bitcoin -- one thing you will hear

429
00:16:31,839 --> 00:16:34,799
a lot is this phrase, "the markets have spoken."

430
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:36,439
What we're looking at here is

431
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:38,958
coingecko.com.  What they do is they

432
00:16:38,959 --> 00:16:40,719
get a list of all the cryptocurrency

433
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:41,999
projects out there;

434
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,159
they ask the question, "how many units of

435
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:45,439
value are out there?"

436
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:47,599
for each of these cryptocurrencies, and

437
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:49,838
what was the most recent trading price

438
00:16:49,839 --> 00:16:51,679
for each of these units of scarcity, and

439
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:52,958
they multiply the two.

440
00:16:52,959 --> 00:16:55,278
When you multiply those two you get a

441
00:16:55,279 --> 00:16:56,958
measure called market cap,

442
00:16:56,959 --> 00:17:00,239
and what that means is, roughly, what is

443
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:03,439
the value of all of the Bitcoin in the world?

444
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:06,719
So, if you were to take everyone's Bitcoin,

445
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:08,798
and put it in a giant pot, what would it

446
00:17:08,799 --> 00:17:10,798
be worth?  Now of course, that's a difficult

447
00:17:10,799 --> 00:17:12,078
question, because

448
00:17:12,079 --> 00:17:14,639
if [only] one person had it, then its value

449
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:16,078
would automatically go down, because

450
00:17:16,079 --> 00:17:18,639
there's a network effect.  But

451
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:21,599
the approximation of using the number of

452
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:23,759
units times the latest market price --

453
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:25,918
that's one of the better forms

454
00:17:25,919 --> 00:17:27,198
of estimate that we have

455
00:17:27,199 --> 00:17:29,599
for the value of a project.  And so this

456
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:31,319
website takes all of the [projects]

457
00:17:31,321 --> 00:17:32,479
[and] it ranks them.

458
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:34,399
So, which cryptocurrency has the largest

459
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:35,918
market cap?  It's Bitcoin.

460
00:17:35,919 --> 00:17:37,928
Number 2 is Ethereum, number 3 is Tether --

461
00:17:37,930 --> 00:17:39,119
I would imagine, even if you're

462
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:40,639
new to cryptocurrency, you're

463
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:44,375
familiar with a list of this kind, and

464
00:17:44,377 --> 00:17:46,479
this is a screenshot from earlier today,

465
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:47,629
and so now you...

466
00:17:47,630 --> 00:17:49,677
you see down here at number 20,

467
00:17:49,679 --> 00:17:52,269
is Monero.

468
00:17:52,271 --> 00:17:53,261
So, you know,

469
00:17:53,263 --> 00:17:55,839
if Monero has all these great characteristics,

470
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:59,279
well, why is it down at number 20 then?

471
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:02,319
And so, this is a question that comes up,

472
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:05,519
and as it happens, my previous background

473
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:08,079
in finance includes questions of this nature,

474
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:10,779
and so that's what I'd like to talk about.

475
00:18:10,781 --> 00:18:14,399
So, the markets have spoken, or have they?

476
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:17,519
I know that this group is

477
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:20,599
quite familiar with the debate in

478
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:22,558
macroeconomics, that is political

479
00:18:22,559 --> 00:18:25,867
economics, of Keynes versus Hayek,

480
00:18:25,869 --> 00:18:27,359
so I won't go into that at all.

481
00:18:27,361 --> 00:18:28,159
I'll assume that

482
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:30,319
you all are versed in at least the

483
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:31,599
basics of that

484
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:34,719
debate, which happens at a national kind

485
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:36,079
of political level,

486
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:37,978
at the macroeconomic level.

487
00:18:37,980 --> 00:18:39,519
But, I don't know if

488
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:41,119
many are aware of this, because I

489
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:42,719
actually never hear crypto people talk

490
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:43,918
about this --

491
00:18:43,919 --> 00:18:45,359
and so I hope that this is actually

492
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:47,279
something new and interesting in the

493
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:48,558
crypto space today --

494
00:18:48,559 --> 00:18:50,639
and that is in microeconomics, there is a

495
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:52,399
similar debate that's going on,

496
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:54,735
and it has been going on for decades.

497
00:18:54,737 --> 00:18:55,599
And this is,

498
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:58,508
neoclassical economics versus

499
00:18:58,510 --> 00:19:00,239
behavioral economics.

500
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:02,159
So first, I'll define what I’m talking

501
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:04,959
about, then I'll give a few examples from the

502
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:06,479
traditional capital markets, and then

503
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:10,239
I'll move to the crypto markets.

504
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:12,862
So, neoclassical economics came first,

505
00:19:12,864 --> 00:19:14,399
so I'll talk about that first.

506
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:17,119
It's the more "old school" version of the

507
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:18,319
world view,

508
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:20,079
and there are two assumptions, basically,

509
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:21,839
in neoclassical economics, and they are

510
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:22,719
the following:

511
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:26,319
people are rational -- that means every person

512
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:28,558
will maximize their own utility, and

513
00:19:28,559 --> 00:19:29,599
utility is just

514
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:31,439
[an] economics word that you could replace

515
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:32,719
that with happiness --

516
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:34,719
people do what they can to maximize

517
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:36,399
their own happiness, given the

518
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:38,639
constraints that they face due to having,

519
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:39,999
you know, a certain budget that they have

520
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,079
to deal with.

521
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:44,159
Second, is that markets are efficient and

522
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:45,599
what that means is that

523
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:47,439
all of the information about any given

524
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:50,399
asset is encoded into the price.

525
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:53,758
And so there's no way to game the system at all.

526
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:55,759
The market price of every asset is

527
00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:57,439
always the "correct" price

528
00:19:57,440 --> 00:19:59,599
that incorporates all known information

529
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:01,279
about that asset.

530
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:03,279
Another way to say this, in the words of

531
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:04,959
Dr. Eugene Fama, who's a professor at the

532
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:06,639
University of Chicago,

533
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:08,798
and also was one of the recipients of

534
00:20:08,799 --> 00:20:10,399
the Nobel in economics for

535
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:13,036
[furthering] theories along this point of view,

536
00:20:13,038 --> 00:20:14,639
is to say that there are no bubbles;

537
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:19,999
there's no such thing as a bubble.

538
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,399
All right, the challenging view is

539
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:23,599
behavioral economics.

540
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:26,639
So, that is the following:

541
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:28,222
let's take that as a given --

542
00:20:28,224 --> 00:20:29,999
OK, people are rational.

543
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,759
OK, let's take it as a given, markets

544
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:33,759
are efficient.  Now, let's also observe

545
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:35,199
that Wall Street makes up

546
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:38,370
21 percent of US [GDP].

547
00:20:38,372 --> 00:20:40,798
So, now, something is a little fishy here,

548
00:20:40,799 --> 00:20:43,999
so if people are so smart and rational,

549
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,079
why do they need this gigantic financial

550
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:47,759
sector to help them do anything?

551
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:50,879
If markets are so efficient why is there

552
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:54,079
so much sales, so much profit, to be made

553
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:56,471
in the financial sector?

554
00:20:56,473 --> 00:21:01,279
Anyone sympathetic to the ethos of cryptocurrency

555
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:02,879
is going to, I think, agree quite

556
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:05,199
wholeheartedly with this.  One thing that

557
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:08,798
crypto has the potential to disintermediate

558
00:21:08,799 --> 00:21:12,639
is this 21 percent of the US economy.

559
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:14,558
So, in the words of Dr. Richard Thaler,

560
00:21:14,559 --> 00:21:16,079
also a University of Chicago

561
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:18,158
professor, who is one of the founders of

562
00:21:18,159 --> 00:21:19,678
behavioral economics,

563
00:21:19,679 --> 00:21:22,079
and also a Nobel prize winner -- he says,

564
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:23,038
"pick two."

565
00:21:23,039 --> 00:21:26,079
So one of these assumptions has to be false --

566
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:27,999
that people are rational or markets are

567
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,883
efficient, or maybe both.

568
00:21:29,885 --> 00:21:32,319
Now, I should add, just speaking as a

569
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:34,079
physicist, that when

570
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:37,439
economists modeled people to be these

571
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:41,119
rational, efficient, happiness maximizers,

572
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:43,199
why did they do that?  That [enabled] them

573
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:45,038
to use the language of mathematics

574
00:21:45,039 --> 00:21:45,918
because

575
00:21:45,919 --> 00:21:49,119
if you think about maximization problems,

576
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:50,639
there's a branch of calculus, for

577
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:52,319
example, variational calculus --

578
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:54,239
basically, tools in mathematics that can

579
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:56,079
be used to apply to the problem,

580
00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:59,359
once you have this quantitative definition

581
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:01,519
of people's behavior as being

582
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:04,440
maximization of some function.

583
00:22:04,442 --> 00:22:07,038
So that enabled economists to, kind of

584
00:22:07,039 --> 00:22:10,079
become a science, so to speak, and take

585
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:12,778
the success of harder sciences like physics

586
00:22:12,780 --> 00:22:14,399
in their quantitative

587
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:17,839
exploration of the way the world works.

588
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:19,759
The drawback of this is that, is it true?

589
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:23,119
Is it really true to make these assumptions?

590
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:25,918
So the behavioral economics worldview

591
00:22:25,919 --> 00:22:27,599
breaks down like this:

592
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:30,959
"Econs" are rational, and "econs" are the

593
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:35,199
word for the fictitious, human-like forms

594
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:38,558
that are hypothesized in the old school

595
00:22:38,559 --> 00:22:41,359
neoclassical economics.  So "econs," you

596
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:43,199
could think of like Dr. Spock, right?

597
00:22:43,201 --> 00:22:45,599
They're [a] kind of robot people,

598
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:48,798
they make perfect decisions under data,

599
00:22:48,799 --> 00:22:50,319
and they would never do anything to

600
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:52,558
sabotage their own self --

601
00:22:52,559 --> 00:22:55,519
so "econs" are rational.  Markets that are

602
00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:58,399
made of "econs" are efficient.

603
00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:00,719
What behavioral economics does is to add

604
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:01,918
the following caveat:

605
00:23:01,919 --> 00:23:05,038
actual people are dumber -- both dumber

606
00:23:05,039 --> 00:23:07,839
in terms of intelligence, and nicer -- in

607
00:23:07,840 --> 00:23:11,918
terms of altruism -- because one feature, I think,

608
00:23:11,919 --> 00:23:13,599
that's evolved in humanity,

609
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:15,519
is that there's a sort of an innate

610
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:17,359
desire in many people

611
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:20,319
to kind of get along.  You don't want to

612
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:22,879
perpetually be at war with your neighbors.

613
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:24,798
You might do a nice thing for somebody

614
00:23:24,799 --> 00:23:26,079
from time to time,

615
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:28,239
even though that might not be strictly

616
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:30,558
in your economic best interest,

617
00:23:30,559 --> 00:23:33,190
like making a donation, or something like that.

618
00:23:33,192 --> 00:23:35,519
These are aspects of human behavior that don't

619
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:37,759
really fit well with the view of

620
00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:40,012
people being "econs."

621
00:23:40,013 --> 00:23:42,263
All right, so in behavioral economics,

622
00:23:42,265 --> 00:23:44,591
the observation is that actual people are both

623
00:23:44,593 --> 00:23:47,058
dumber and nicer than "econs" --

624
00:23:47,060 --> 00:23:48,779
and in predictable ways --

625
00:23:48,781 --> 00:23:52,087
and so, that is the interesting part of this.

626
00:23:52,089 --> 00:23:54,158
All right, so I’m going to give a couple examples of

627
00:23:54,159 --> 00:23:56,959
how this shows up in capital markets but first,

628
00:23:56,960 --> 00:23:59,519
I have to give a 101 of accounting.

629
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:01,439
So, the fundamental identity of

630
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:03,278
accounting is A = L + E.

631
00:24:03,279 --> 00:24:06,046
You can think of that as "ALE," like the drink,

632
00:24:06,048 --> 00:24:08,960
so that is a mnemonic to remember this.

633
00:24:08,962 --> 00:24:10,558
What this is saying is that

634
00:24:10,559 --> 00:24:12,879
every company -- or it could be a person, or

635
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:14,239
it could be a country,

636
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:17,038
it works at any sort of level -- but let's

637
00:24:17,039 --> 00:24:17,918
just stick with the

638
00:24:17,919 --> 00:24:19,839
example of a company.  A company is a

639
00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:21,759
thing that has a bunch of assets --

640
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:24,959
it might have factories, and so on.  These

641
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:28,879
assets get divided into two parts.

642
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:31,038
There are people who that the company

643
00:24:31,039 --> 00:24:32,719
owes money to.

644
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:36,158
It basically had to get a loan from the bank,

645
00:24:36,159 --> 00:24:37,599
or if it's big enough, maybe it would

646
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:39,918
have issued its own corporate bonds.

647
00:24:39,919 --> 00:24:42,959
Those are basically IOUs, those are liabilities.

648
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:45,999
And under corporate legal structure,

649
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,158
if a company goes bankrupt, and these

650
00:24:48,159 --> 00:24:49,439
assets get sold,

651
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:52,239
then the liabilities must get paid first.

652
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:53,199
The people who

653
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:55,599
made loans of cold hard cash -- they must

654
00:24:55,600 --> 00:24:57,439
be first in line to get the

655
00:24:57,440 --> 00:25:01,999
pickings of the dead company's sold assets.

656
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:05,599
So whatever is not owed

657
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:08,719
to outside lenders, is the

658
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:11,329
property of the owners, and that is equity,

659
00:25:11,331 --> 00:25:12,639
and this is the stock market.

660
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:13,925
So this is the bond market on top,

661
00:25:13,927 --> 00:25:15,759
this is the stock market on bottom.

662
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:16,913
So they add up.

663
00:25:16,914 --> 00:25:19,519
So you have a bunch of assets --

664
00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:21,839
some of it is owed to money lenders, and

665
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:24,399
the rest is owned by the owners.

666
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:26,479
Shares of stock represent shares of

667
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:28,959
equity.  So if there's a million shares of

668
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:29,839
this company,

669
00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:31,678
you think of this blue box now as being

670
00:25:31,679 --> 00:25:34,639
divided into one million little [squares.]

671
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:36,879
Each one of those little squares gives

672
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:39,359
the owner of that share of stock

673
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:43,839
the right to the [one-millionth] share of profits

674
00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:46,959
that company management decides to spit out

675
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:50,239
to the shareholders, and these are called dividends.

676
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:52,639
So now you think of the assets as being

677
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:54,959
like a factory, you have a factory that makes

678
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:57,349
computers or something like that --

679
00:25:57,351 --> 00:25:59,119
as it makes the computers, customers

680
00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:00,319
are pumping in

681
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:02,569
money to pay for those computers,

682
00:26:02,571 --> 00:26:05,119
so the cash is part of these assets --

683
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:07,142
so one thing the management [can do]

684
00:26:07,144 --> 00:26:08,639
is to elect to

685
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:10,798
plow those assets back into the company

686
00:26:10,799 --> 00:26:12,079
to grow it --

687
00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:13,519
but another thing that the company could

688
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:15,599
do, is if it doesn't have any smart

689
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:17,589
plans to expand the company,

690
00:26:17,591 --> 00:26:19,199
it can spit out that [cash]

691
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:23,998
back to the owners, which is the form of dividends.

692
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,558
All right.  So, are prices always right?

693
00:26:26,559 --> 00:26:28,165
And there are four challenges

694
00:26:28,167 --> 00:26:30,430
to that notion, from empirical evidence,

695
00:26:30,432 --> 00:26:31,359
that I’m going to show.

696
00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:33,918
The first one is from Robert Shiller,

697
00:26:33,919 --> 00:26:35,278
who got the Nobel in

698
00:26:35,279 --> 00:26:38,719
2013 for this work.  Basically what

699
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:40,479
Dr. Shiller showed was, here you're

700
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:43,519
looking at actual stock prices in blue,

701
00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:46,558
and in red, you're looking at what the

702
00:26:46,559 --> 00:26:49,364
stock price should have been

703
00:26:49,366 --> 00:26:51,758
if the stock owner had known

704
00:26:51,760 --> 00:26:54,719
what the next 30 years of dividends was

705
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:57,742
going to look like for that stock.

706
00:26:57,744 --> 00:27:00,718
So, if you buy a share of Tesla right now,

707
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:02,879
you don't know if dividends are going to

708
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:06,008
be paid on that stock, ever.

709
00:27:06,010 --> 00:27:07,119
It could be 10 years from now, it

710
00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:09,198
could be 20 years from now, you don't know --

711
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:11,439
but you're buying it partly because you

712
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:13,759
think that Tesla is going to do so well in the future

713
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:15,580
that it's going to have extra cash

714
00:27:15,582 --> 00:27:16,798
that it would be able to

715
00:27:16,799 --> 00:27:19,199
send to you in the form of dividends.

716
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:20,398
So what this study is saying

717
00:27:20,399 --> 00:27:22,879
is that even if you had perfect advance

718
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:24,798
knowledge of how much dividends would be

719
00:27:24,799 --> 00:27:28,046
coming your way as a shareholder,

720
00:27:28,048 --> 00:27:29,359
If you had perfect knowledge

721
00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:31,439
you would price the stock like this

722
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:32,639
dotted red line.

723
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:34,558
But what the market actually did was

724
00:27:34,559 --> 00:27:36,558
price the stock like this blue line.

725
00:27:36,559 --> 00:27:40,158
In other words there are huge differences

726
00:27:40,159 --> 00:27:43,278
between a quote-unquote fair value and

727
00:27:43,279 --> 00:27:45,119
what the market determines to be the

728
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:46,959
fair value, and you can see here that

729
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:50,965
these periods of inflation, inflated prices,

730
00:27:50,967 --> 00:27:54,239
can last for decades -- it's not necessarily the

731
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:56,398
case that -- oh, there's a short-term

732
00:27:56,399 --> 00:28:00,320
blip in the price.

733
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:02,558
Another example, and this one I was directly

734
00:28:02,559 --> 00:28:04,158
involved with, actually -- so there was a

735
00:28:04,159 --> 00:28:07,999
paper called "Liquidity as an Investment Style"

736
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:10,398
and I was a co-author of this with [Prof.] Roger

737
00:28:10,399 --> 00:28:12,319
Ibbotson at the [Yale] School of Management --

738
00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:14,879
it did get some play, it won an award

739
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:16,020
for being the "paper of the year"

740
00:28:16,022 --> 00:28:17,997
in the Financial Analysts Journal

741
00:28:17,998 --> 00:28:18,959
-- that was given by the CFA

742
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:20,319
Institute, which is kind of the

743
00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:22,079
credentialing body for

744
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:24,319
investment analysts in the US, and

745
00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:25,519
actually, around the world --

746
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:27,472
that award got picked up by The Economist,

747
00:28:27,474 --> 00:28:29,747
which is a UK news magazine --

748
00:28:29,749 --> 00:28:31,119
and so here's a chart that

749
00:28:31,120 --> 00:28:32,933
I helped to make --

750
00:28:32,935 --> 00:28:35,038
and what this is showing is:

751
00:28:35,039 --> 00:28:37,312
let's say you take US stocks,

752
00:28:37,314 --> 00:28:39,706
and you sort them into four bins.

753
00:28:39,708 --> 00:28:41,278
The method that you use

754
00:28:41,279 --> 00:28:42,639
to determine which bin

755
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:45,599
each stock goes in is:  you look at the

756
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:46,719
previous year,

757
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:48,719
and you ask the question, how much

758
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:50,959
trading volume happened in that stock

759
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:52,671
over the last year?

760
00:28:52,672 --> 00:28:53,599
So, if it had a lot of

761
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:55,278
trading volume you'd put it into the

762
00:28:55,279 --> 00:28:58,158
4th, the highest bin of trading volume.

763
00:28:58,159 --> 00:29:00,479
Whereas, if you have a stock that's basically

764
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:02,879
ignored -- nobody cares about it, nobody

765
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:04,896
talks about it, everyone thinks

766
00:29:04,898 --> 00:29:06,798
it's not cool to talk about it --

767
00:29:06,799 --> 00:29:09,199
that would go in the 1st bucket here.

768
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:10,558
And what we find,

769
00:29:10,559 --> 00:29:12,959
is that if you look at [the] following

770
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:15,038
year's return of that stock,

771
00:29:15,039 --> 00:29:17,999
you see this pattern:  that the ignored

772
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:19,839
and forgotten stocks are the ones that

773
00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:22,798
will outperform in future years as opposed to

774
00:29:22,799 --> 00:29:24,798
the "hot stocks" that everyone knows

775
00:29:24,799 --> 00:29:26,230
and everybody talks about,

776
00:29:26,231 --> 00:29:28,479
and everybody trades.

777
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:31,359
So, that's another very interesting kind

778
00:29:31,360 --> 00:29:34,012
of behavioral thing, and it invites

779
00:29:34,014 --> 00:29:36,079
kind of a theory of popularity

780
00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:39,519
in which you have unpopular things

781
00:29:39,520 --> 00:29:41,599
which everyone has ignored and forgotten

782
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:43,439
about, and as a result, the price goes

783
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:44,798
down, because nobody

784
00:29:44,799 --> 00:29:47,839
cares about it.  Then, in the future, some

785
00:29:47,840 --> 00:29:48,798
news happens --

786
00:29:48,799 --> 00:29:51,278
it becomes hot in the future, and when it

787
00:29:51,279 --> 00:29:52,879
becomes hot, when it becomes

788
00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:55,359
talked about, then the price goes up and

789
00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:56,558
that is what is

790
00:29:56,559 --> 00:29:58,798
explaining these high returns here.

791
00:29:58,799 --> 00:30:00,719
And the opposite happens.  So if you have

792
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:03,038
some "flavor of the day" kind of stock

793
00:30:03,039 --> 00:30:04,558
that everyone's talking about,

794
00:30:04,559 --> 00:30:06,398
those are the ones that you actually

795
00:30:06,399 --> 00:30:07,599
want to avoid,

796
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:09,839
you want to have a caution flag on those --

797
00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:10,639
because those

798
00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:13,407
tend to have their day in the sun,

799
00:30:13,409 --> 00:30:15,439
you find out about it while it's having its

800
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:16,319
day in the sun,

801
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:18,563
then its day in the sun is gone,

802
00:30:18,565 --> 00:30:21,005
its 15 minutes [of fame] are gone --

803
00:30:21,007 --> 00:30:23,119
when the interest goes away, then the price

804
00:30:23,120 --> 00:30:25,840
goes down too.

805
00:30:26,159 --> 00:30:28,798
The dot-com bubble was a time in history

806
00:30:28,799 --> 00:30:30,639
when the Internet was new.

807
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:32,398
In case there are maybe younger people

808
00:30:32,399 --> 00:30:33,999
in the audience who didn't live through

809
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:35,278
the dot-com bubble,

810
00:30:35,279 --> 00:30:38,079
it was a very interesting time because

811
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:40,479
if you had any sort of company

812
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:43,759
that had any sort of stupid idea, and you

813
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:46,797
added "dot com" to the end of the company name,

814
00:30:46,799 --> 00:30:48,719
people would go crazy for it because it

815
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:50,558
was using this hot new thing called the

816
00:30:50,559 --> 00:30:51,199
"Internet" --

817
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:54,479
which was brand spanking new, back then.

818
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:57,085
And so there was this company called pets.com,

819
00:30:57,087 --> 00:30:59,038
and its idea was to

820
00:30:59,039 --> 00:31:02,798
FedEx 50 pound bags of dog food to people

821
00:31:02,799 --> 00:31:06,398
and charge grocery store prices

822
00:31:06,399 --> 00:31:08,558
even though they were, you know, taking a

823
00:31:08,559 --> 00:31:10,946
bath on the shipping -- but!

824
00:31:10,948 --> 00:31:12,639
But, they were using the Internet to

825
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:13,599
take their orders.

826
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:15,721
And so this was a hot company,

827
00:31:15,723 --> 00:31:17,867
they went through an IPO,

828
00:31:17,869 --> 00:31:19,599
it actually got investment from

829
00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:22,479
amazon.com, if you can believe that,

830
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:26,079
and it's an example of how

831
00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:28,959
a new technology can promote

832
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:30,719
inefficiency in pricing.

833
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:32,158
In other words -- when you have a new

834
00:31:32,159 --> 00:31:35,038
technology that is not very well understood

835
00:31:35,039 --> 00:31:37,439
among the people, that is the time when

836
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:39,599
everyone's going to take their stupid idea,

837
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:42,239
add "dot com," and advertise it as being the

838
00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:44,639
next best thing since sliced bread.

839
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:47,599
And, so, of course -- [a] very similar thing is

840
00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:49,330
happening with blockchain, right?

841
00:31:49,332 --> 00:31:51,518
So take any sort of idea you can

842
00:31:51,519 --> 00:31:53,199
possibly think of -- doesn't matter

843
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:55,278
how stupid it is -- and you make it a

844
00:31:55,279 --> 00:31:56,798
blockchain thing,

845
00:31:56,799 --> 00:31:59,999
you issue an ICO,

846
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:03,760
you know, you might do okay.

847
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:07,333
Finally:  are prices always right?

848
00:32:07,335 --> 00:32:08,810
Well, if you

849
00:32:08,811 --> 00:32:10,798
accept the efficient market hypothesis,

850
00:32:10,799 --> 00:32:14,079
then, yes, prices are always right.

851
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:15,439
But let's look at

852
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:17,359
just a few years ago.  So, now, we're not

853
00:32:17,360 --> 00:32:19,119
talking about the [90s when] the Internet was

854
00:32:19,120 --> 00:32:20,319
new, we're talking just

855
00:32:20,320 --> 00:32:22,456
four years ago, three and a half years ago.

856
00:32:22,458 --> 00:32:24,079
This is what the market cap list

857
00:32:24,080 --> 00:32:26,776
looked like in late October 2017,

858
00:32:26,778 --> 00:32:28,625
and you can see number 8 here,

859
00:32:28,627 --> 00:32:30,574
there's this thing called Bitconnect.

860
00:32:30,576 --> 00:32:34,769
And again, if you are new to the crypto space,

861
00:32:34,771 --> 00:32:35,740
you should study this.

862
00:32:35,742 --> 00:32:38,996
You should study this total scam Ponzi scheme

863
00:32:38,998 --> 00:32:40,319
called Bitconnect,

864
00:32:40,320 --> 00:32:43,199
which managed to become number 8

865
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:44,239
on the ranking charts

866
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:46,381
as far as cryptocurrency.

867
00:32:46,382 --> 00:32:47,759
Part of their

868
00:32:47,760 --> 00:32:51,839
official website actually included this pyramid

869
00:32:51,840 --> 00:32:53,839
It would be hard for them to [make it] more

870
00:32:53,840 --> 00:32:56,479
obvious that this was a pyramid scheme.

871
00:32:56,480 --> 00:33:00,719
And this particular date, October 28, 2017,

872
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:01,839
was the date when this

873
00:33:01,840 --> 00:33:04,879
video which became a sort of classic meme

874
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:06,639
in crypto, came out, in which this

875
00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:07,918
gentleman here

876
00:33:07,919 --> 00:33:10,239
did very little but scream "Bitconnect"

877
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:11,439
into a microphone

878
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:13,768
and people thought it was great.

879
00:33:13,770 --> 00:33:15,518
So, of course, you had this ironic

880
00:33:15,519 --> 00:33:17,518
section of crypto people who kind of

881
00:33:17,519 --> 00:33:19,439
laughed at it and thought it was a big joke --

882
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:21,439
but, you know, this is real money!  This is

883
00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:23,359
like, one and a half billion dollars that

884
00:33:23,360 --> 00:33:27,760
people ended up losing to this fraud.

885
00:33:28,559 --> 00:33:29,749
Be careful.

886
00:33:29,750 --> 00:33:32,079
So, is a current

887
00:33:32,080 --> 00:33:35,839
high market cap indicative of merit?

888
00:33:35,840 --> 00:33:39,840
I'll ask it again: are prices always right?

889
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:44,297
In 1936, Keynes, the economist --

890
00:33:44,299 --> 00:33:45,439
going back to the

891
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:47,278
first slide about Keynes versus Hayek --

892
00:33:47,279 --> 00:33:49,278
this is one politically neutral

893
00:33:49,279 --> 00:33:51,678
observation that he had, and this was

894
00:33:51,679 --> 00:33:54,079
pertaining a newspaper contest that was

895
00:33:54,080 --> 00:33:55,918
published in 1936.

896
00:33:55,919 --> 00:33:58,079
And so what this contest did was it

897
00:33:58,080 --> 00:33:59,199
published one [hundred]

898
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:01,653
photos of [attractive] people.

899
00:34:01,655 --> 00:34:04,621
So, 100 photos and 100 names on them --

900
00:34:04,623 --> 00:34:07,119
and it said, okay, we're going to do a contest here

901
00:34:07,120 --> 00:34:09,184
and what we want you to do is,

902
00:34:09,186 --> 00:34:10,878
you pick the six prettiest

903
00:34:10,879 --> 00:34:12,356
people on this page,

904
00:34:12,358 --> 00:34:13,553
you write their names down,

905
00:34:13,555 --> 00:34:15,758
and you send it into our newspaper.

906
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:17,519
The winner of this contest is going to

907
00:34:17,520 --> 00:34:19,039
be whoever it is

908
00:34:19,040 --> 00:34:23,519
who chose the most popular pretty photos.

909
00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:27,199
So now, Keynes' observation was this:

910
00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:29,279
what is your best strategy?  Is your best

911
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:31,918
strategy to actually pick the six

912
00:34:31,919 --> 00:34:34,638
photos that you think are the prettiest?

913
00:34:34,639 --> 00:34:36,959
That would be maybe your first reaction.

914
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:39,667
But if you think about it a bit more,

915
00:34:39,669 --> 00:34:42,532
you might have weird taste, right?

916
00:34:42,534 --> 00:34:43,358
You might have taste

917
00:34:43,359 --> 00:34:44,959
that is not reflective

918
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:47,999
of everybody else.  So, the second

919
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:50,409
iteration of your strategy would be:

920
00:34:50,411 --> 00:34:52,158
I'm going to pick the six people

921
00:34:52,159 --> 00:34:56,157
who I think everybody else thinks is pretty.

922
00:34:56,159 --> 00:34:58,166
so basically you imagine

923
00:34:58,167 --> 00:34:59,838
what the population

924
00:34:59,839 --> 00:35:01,358
thinks they're gonna like and you're

925
00:35:01,359 --> 00:35:03,358
going to guess that.  You can even take

926
00:35:03,359 --> 00:35:05,039
that a step further:  you can say,

927
00:35:05,040 --> 00:35:06,159
well, that's okay, but

928
00:35:06,160 --> 00:35:07,679
other guys are going to do that too so

929
00:35:07,680 --> 00:35:10,559
what I need to do, is I need to

930
00:35:10,560 --> 00:35:13,679
think about the people who are thinking

931
00:35:13,680 --> 00:35:15,543
about everybody else

932
00:35:15,544 --> 00:35:16,799
and selecting what they

933
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:18,078
think the 6 prettiest.. right, so it

934
00:35:18,079 --> 00:35:19,199
gets very circular,

935
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:21,279
gets very complicated, [and] Keynes'

936
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:22,399
observation was

937
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:23,838
that this is really what the stock

938
00:35:23,839 --> 00:35:26,159
market is like.  It's not

939
00:35:26,160 --> 00:35:29,838
direct merit that price is capturing,

940
00:35:29,839 --> 00:35:33,279
it's a derivative of it.  And it has

941
00:35:33,280 --> 00:35:35,598
an estimation of what you think everyone

942
00:35:35,599 --> 00:35:37,838
else is thinking, in it.

943
00:35:37,839 --> 00:35:39,598
So that leads to this quote here:  "In the

944
00:35:39,599 --> 00:35:42,078
short run, the market is a voting machine,

945
00:35:42,079 --> 00:35:43,118
but in the long run,

946
00:35:43,119 --> 00:35:45,699
it is a weighing machine."

947
00:35:45,700 --> 00:35:48,799
In the short run it's a popularity contest,

948
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:51,519
and popularity contests can have winners

949
00:35:51,520 --> 00:35:53,279
that are not necessarily the most

950
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:54,559
[meritorious] --

951
00:35:54,560 --> 00:35:58,319
but in the long run, those kind of popularity

952
00:35:58,320 --> 00:35:59,999
fads are going to come and go, and what

953
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:05,040
you're left with is merit, in the long term.

954
00:36:06,240 --> 00:36:09,028
All right.  So, [in] behavioral economics

955
00:36:09,030 --> 00:36:10,078
there was one

956
00:36:10,079 --> 00:36:12,159
particularly important Nobel prize that

957
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:15,039
pinpointed two very specific things

958
00:36:15,040 --> 00:36:18,639
that people do that are not rational.

959
00:36:18,640 --> 00:36:20,631
If you don't know these, this is,

960
00:36:20,633 --> 00:36:22,239
I would say, among the most important

961
00:36:22,240 --> 00:36:23,439
discoveries, I'd say, of the

962
00:36:23,440 --> 00:36:24,879
20th century, I mean this is

963
00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:27,198
important to know, and not everyone knows it.

964
00:36:27,200 --> 00:36:29,838
So if you know it, and other people don't,

965
00:36:29,839 --> 00:36:32,398
you're gonna have a bit of an edge on them.

966
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:34,078
This is called prospect theory, and the

967
00:36:34,079 --> 00:36:35,519
reason it's called prospect theory

968
00:36:35,520 --> 00:36:38,879
is that it talks about how people make decisions

969
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:41,919
about their future prospects.  They have

970
00:36:41,920 --> 00:36:43,919
two main observations:  number one,

971
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:47,358
people perceive the pain of loss more intensely

972
00:36:47,359 --> 00:36:50,399
than equally sized gains.  So, going back

973
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:51,598
to the "econ," this

974
00:36:51,599 --> 00:36:53,759
Dr. Spock character who the

975
00:36:53,760 --> 00:36:56,639
[neo]classical economics is based on --

976
00:36:56,640 --> 00:36:59,660
this classic character, like basically a robot --

977
00:36:59,662 --> 00:37:01,439
if you go up to a robot and say,

978
00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:03,199
we're going to flip a coin, if it comes

979
00:37:03,200 --> 00:37:04,879
up heads I’m going to give you a dollar,

980
00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:06,319
if it comes up tails, I’m going to take a

981
00:37:06,320 --> 00:37:08,559
dollar from you -- then the robot should

982
00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:10,159
think that's a neutral game,

983
00:37:10,160 --> 00:37:11,439
they should not really have an opinion

984
00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:13,199
on it.  But if you go to a human

985
00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:15,279
and do that -- if I were to come up to you,

986
00:37:15,280 --> 00:37:16,639
and say, "we're going to flip a coin, if

987
00:37:16,640 --> 00:37:18,559
it's heads, I’m giving you a dollar, if it

988
00:37:18,560 --> 00:37:21,279
tails, I’m taking a dollar from you" --

989
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:22,639
now think of what's going to happen when

990
00:37:22,640 --> 00:37:24,147
we do that game, and it comes up heads --

991
00:37:24,149 --> 00:37:25,279
I give you a dollar,

992
00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:27,615
and you say, "oh okay, great, thanks...

993
00:37:27,617 --> 00:37:29,679
I won a dollar."

994
00:37:29,680 --> 00:37:31,234
Let's say it comes out the opposite --

995
00:37:31,236 --> 00:37:33,170
I take a dollar from you.  Well, you know,

996
00:37:33,172 --> 00:37:34,857
our friendship might be over, basically.

997
00:37:34,859 --> 00:37:37,919
You might not invite me to lunch next time.

998
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:40,959
Things like that are processed

999
00:37:40,960 --> 00:37:43,358
by a different part of the brain than

1000
00:37:43,359 --> 00:37:46,239
the part of the brain that processes reward.

1001
00:37:46,240 --> 00:37:48,719
It's basically a more primal part of the

1002
00:37:48,720 --> 00:37:50,799
brain that is processing

1003
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:52,479
negative [consequences.]  And there could

1004
00:37:52,480 --> 00:37:55,234
be evolutionary basis for this.

1005
00:37:55,236 --> 00:37:57,919
So, imagine caveman 1

1006
00:37:57,920 --> 00:38:00,559
walks by a tiger cave and says,

1007
00:38:00,560 --> 00:38:02,239
"oh, there's only a one percent chance that

1008
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:04,399
the tiger's in there and it's going to eat me.

1009
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:05,999
So, you know, I’m going to go -- because you

1010
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:07,439
know, it's just a one percent chance" and

1011
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:09,358
then they get eaten.

1012
00:38:09,359 --> 00:38:11,759
Caveman B walks by the same cave and

1013
00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:14,399
says, "oh, there's a tiger in there.  There's no

1014
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:16,078
way I’m getting anywhere near that.

1015
00:38:16,079 --> 00:38:18,399
I don't care what the probability is."  So

1016
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:20,879
basically it could be that the people who

1017
00:38:20,880 --> 00:38:23,919
overemphasized threats were the ones who

1018
00:38:23,920 --> 00:38:25,896
survived evolutionarily.

1019
00:38:25,898 --> 00:38:28,319
So, neoclassical person --

1020
00:38:28,320 --> 00:38:30,799
here, I’m showing a utility curve.  On the

1021
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:32,959
horizontal axis, we're looking at something like

1022
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:35,527
wealth -- so this is how much wealth you have --

1023
00:38:35,529 --> 00:38:36,799
have and on the vertical axis we're

1024
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:38,319
talking about how happy you are

1025
00:38:38,320 --> 00:38:40,583
with your wealth.  And,

1026
00:38:40,585 --> 00:38:43,107
what you see for neoclassical person is

1027
00:38:43,109 --> 00:38:44,793
[the] law of diminishing returns,

1028
00:38:44,794 --> 00:38:45,358
which you might be

1029
00:38:45,359 --> 00:38:47,199
familiar with from economics --

1030
00:38:47,200 --> 00:38:50,479
that says:  if you have sat through a long day

1031
00:38:50,480 --> 00:38:54,078
of nine talks at a crypto conference

1032
00:38:54,079 --> 00:38:57,597
then the additional value to you of the 10th talk

1033
00:38:57,599 --> 00:39:00,501
(which happens to be my talk today, number 10)

1034
00:39:00,503 --> 00:39:02,819
is not going to be that much better.

1035
00:39:02,821 --> 00:39:04,799
You don't get that much additional

1036
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:06,879
happiness out of that talk number 10.

1037
00:39:06,880 --> 00:39:09,919
That is why this curve flattens out.

1038
00:39:09,920 --> 00:39:11,679
It never starts going down -- it's never

1039
00:39:11,680 --> 00:39:14,399
the case that more wealth makes you less happy

1040
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:16,319
it's that the rate of happiness increase

1041
00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:18,719
slows down as you get richer.

1042
00:39:18,720 --> 00:39:23,199
All right, so this is neoclassical robot person.

1043
00:39:23,200 --> 00:39:25,999
How do actual people behave?

1044
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:29,379
The behavioral function looks like this, in which

1045
00:39:29,381 --> 00:39:31,679
it matters where your current level is.

1046
00:39:31,680 --> 00:39:34,399
If your current level is here on wealth,

1047
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:36,639
then you will act rationally about that one

1048
00:39:36,640 --> 00:39:38,479
additional dollar.  But if you think about

1049
00:39:38,480 --> 00:39:41,279
the prospect of one dollar being taken from you,

1050
00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:42,639
now that's a different situation, you

1051
00:39:42,640 --> 00:39:44,319
become much less happy.

1052
00:39:44,320 --> 00:39:46,239
And, in fact, it turns out to be about

1053
00:39:46,240 --> 00:39:47,759
twice as unhappy.

1054
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:51,679
So basically, a one dollar loss makes you

1055
00:39:51,680 --> 00:39:53,919
approximately the same emotional

1056
00:39:53,920 --> 00:39:57,598
reaction as a two dollar gain.

1057
00:39:57,599 --> 00:40:00,719
So this is a key insight and

1058
00:40:00,720 --> 00:40:03,279
it's something to know that you might be

1059
00:40:03,280 --> 00:40:05,279
doing when you are thinking about potential

1060
00:40:05,280 --> 00:40:10,479
losses. They will be magnified in your brain.

1061
00:40:10,480 --> 00:40:12,799
Prospect theory, the second part, is that

1062
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:15,039
people crudely approximate probabilities

1063
00:40:15,040 --> 00:40:17,279
into three categories.

1064
00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:19,919
So here I’m plotting on the horizontal

1065
00:40:19,920 --> 00:40:21,759
axis is an actual probability of

1066
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:22,799
something happening,

1067
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:24,799
and on the vertical axis, this is the

1068
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:27,519
perceived probability -- this is what a human being

1069
00:40:27,520 --> 00:40:30,559
thinks the probability is, in their brain,

1070
00:40:30,560 --> 00:40:33,490
when they're deciding what to do.

1071
00:40:33,492 --> 00:40:35,118
So neoclassical

1072
00:40:35,119 --> 00:40:38,123
robot person here has no bias.

1073
00:40:38,125 --> 00:40:40,399
Whataver the actual probability is,

1074
00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:42,559
that's going to be the exact perception

1075
00:40:42,560 --> 00:40:47,101
of the probability, and they will act rationally.

1076
00:40:47,103 --> 00:40:49,199
How do actual people behave?

1077
00:40:49,200 --> 00:40:52,639
Actual people tend to

1078
00:40:52,640 --> 00:40:54,719
categorize probabilities into three

1079
00:40:54,720 --> 00:40:55,999
crude buckets.

1080
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:59,358
Those buckets are:  "never going to happen,"

1081
00:40:59,359 --> 00:41:02,879
"maybe" -- so, basically a 50-50 coin flip --

1082
00:41:02,880 --> 00:41:05,320
and "for sure."

1083
00:41:05,322 --> 00:41:07,439
So, if something has a one percent chance

1084
00:41:07,440 --> 00:41:10,879
of happening, people often will simply

1085
00:41:10,880 --> 00:41:13,598
simplify that, and say, "never going to happen" --

1086
00:41:13,599 --> 00:41:14,959
or, you could have people who

1087
00:41:14,960 --> 00:41:17,358
round up -- and say that one percent chance

1088
00:41:17,359 --> 00:41:19,926
is going to happen like 50-50.

1089
00:41:19,928 --> 00:41:21,118
So it turns out that

1090
00:41:21,119 --> 00:41:24,399
people are pretty bad at assessing

1091
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:26,159
probabilities, and it turns out

1092
00:41:26,160 --> 00:41:28,639
that what you would think of as standard

1093
00:41:28,640 --> 00:41:30,479
measures of intelligence --

1094
00:41:30,480 --> 00:41:34,078
they will not exempt a genius from being

1095
00:41:34,079 --> 00:41:35,439
susceptible to this bias.

1096
00:41:35,440 --> 00:41:38,319
It happens to them too.

1097
00:41:39,920 --> 00:41:42,479
All right, so let's apply that.  OK, I'm

1098
00:41:42,480 --> 00:41:43,759
the insurance company

1099
00:41:43,760 --> 00:41:47,279
and I’m going to offer you -- because

1100
00:41:47,280 --> 00:41:49,039
planes are scary, and dangerous, and they

1101
00:41:49,040 --> 00:41:50,418
could fall out of the sky, you know,

1102
00:41:50,420 --> 00:41:51,759
it's been known to happen --

1103
00:41:51,760 --> 00:41:54,239
so we're going to offer you this $100,000

1104
00:41:54,240 --> 00:41:55,358
insurance policy,

1105
00:41:55,359 --> 00:41:59,199
and we will pay that if your plane crashes.

1106
00:41:59,200 --> 00:42:01,118
What is the actual probability of that

1107
00:42:01,119 --> 00:42:02,879
happening?  Well, of course,

1108
00:42:02,880 --> 00:42:04,318
you know, it's going to be very, very,

1109
00:42:04,319 --> 00:42:07,039
small -- it's about 1 in 10 million.

1110
00:42:07,040 --> 00:42:10,239
Let's say you charge one penny for that

1111
00:42:10,240 --> 00:42:11,279
insurance policy,

1112
00:42:11,280 --> 00:42:12,897
as the insurance company.

1113
00:42:12,899 --> 00:42:14,799
That means 10 million times,

1114
00:42:14,800 --> 00:42:17,140
people are going to [pay a] penny.

1115
00:42:17,142 --> 00:42:19,118
One of those times out of the 10 million,

1116
00:42:19,119 --> 00:42:20,879
somebody's going to crash, and you as the

1117
00:42:20,880 --> 00:42:22,318
insurance company, are going to have to pay

1118
00:42:22,319 --> 00:42:24,559
out the $100,000.

1119
00:42:24,560 --> 00:42:27,008
The ten million pennies that you collected --

1120
00:42:27,010 --> 00:42:29,919
that is the same as $100,000.

1121
00:42:29,920 --> 00:42:30,639
In other words,

1122
00:42:30,640 --> 00:42:32,553
the $100,000 you collected

1123
00:42:32,555 --> 00:42:34,078
as premiums, is the same as the

1124
00:42:34,079 --> 00:42:37,171
$100,000 you paid out, as a [claims] payment.

1125
00:42:37,173 --> 00:42:40,239
So the fair [price] for an insurance policy

1126
00:42:40,240 --> 00:42:43,598
like this is one penny.

1127
00:42:43,599 --> 00:42:45,388
Why do they sell this?

1128
00:42:45,390 --> 00:42:46,959
They sell this because they

1129
00:42:46,960 --> 00:42:49,598
know that there's a subset of people

1130
00:42:49,599 --> 00:42:51,199
who are going to take that one in a million

1131
00:42:51,200 --> 00:42:52,318
probability,

1132
00:42:52,319 --> 00:42:54,639
and in their minds, instead of rounding

1133
00:42:54,640 --> 00:42:56,959
it down to the "never" bucket,

1134
00:42:56,960 --> 00:42:58,799
because it's a fear, they're going to

1135
00:42:58,800 --> 00:43:00,078
round that probability

1136
00:43:00,079 --> 00:43:03,118
up to the "maybe" bucket.

1137
00:43:03,119 --> 00:43:05,039
This is an exaggerated perception of

1138
00:43:05,040 --> 00:43:06,559
loss -- so that's the first part of

1139
00:43:06,560 --> 00:43:07,838
prospect theory remember?

1140
00:43:07,839 --> 00:43:09,838
So if you're thinking about a loss

1141
00:43:09,839 --> 00:43:11,838
versus a gain, your brain is going to

1142
00:43:11,839 --> 00:43:15,512
magnify the badness of that bad thing.

1143
00:43:15,514 --> 00:43:17,021
It's like little kids,

1144
00:43:17,022 --> 00:43:19,357
being [scared of a] monster under the covers --

1145
00:43:19,359 --> 00:43:20,676
your imagination's going to come up

1146
00:43:20,678 --> 00:43:22,639
[with] something crazy and [because it's]

1147
00:43:22,640 --> 00:43:25,199
a bad thing, you're going to magnify

1148
00:43:25,200 --> 00:43:26,369
the importance of that,

1149
00:43:26,371 --> 00:43:27,957
or the likelihood of that.

1150
00:43:27,959 --> 00:43:29,759
So, in this case,

1151
00:43:29,760 --> 00:43:31,559
the person that they're targeting --

1152
00:43:31,561 --> 00:43:32,799
the customer type that

1153
00:43:32,800 --> 00:43:34,799
an insurance company like this is trying

1154
00:43:34,800 --> 00:43:36,399
to make a buck off of --

1155
00:43:36,400 --> 00:43:37,838
is the type of person who has an

1156
00:43:37,839 --> 00:43:39,999
exaggerated perception of loss,

1157
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:43,199
and so their perceived probability of a crash

1158
00:43:43,200 --> 00:43:45,118
gets rounded up, to the "maybe" bucket,

1159
00:43:45,119 --> 00:43:47,999
instead of the "never going to happen" bucket.

1160
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:50,399
So, let's say this person now thinks that

1161
00:43:50,400 --> 00:43:52,314
they have a 1 in 1,000

1162
00:43:52,316 --> 00:43:55,039
chance of being in a plane crash.

1163
00:43:55,040 --> 00:43:58,077
Every 1,000 flights, they're going to die once.

1164
00:43:58,079 --> 00:44:01,118
And so, if they think that, then it's

1165
00:44:01,119 --> 00:44:03,315
going to be worth $100 to them

1166
00:44:03,317 --> 00:44:06,398
to have a policy that pays $100,000 upon death.

1167
00:44:06,400 --> 00:44:07,679
And so, of course, this company's going to

1168
00:44:07,680 --> 00:44:09,759
price their thing at, like $50 --

1169
00:44:09,760 --> 00:44:12,078
you know, it's grossly overpriced for the

1170
00:44:12,079 --> 00:44:13,439
insurance that they're offering --

1171
00:44:13,440 --> 00:44:15,199
but they're going to be enough suckers

1172
00:44:15,200 --> 00:44:16,719
to make it a profitable thing.

1173
00:44:16,720 --> 00:44:19,999
This is an example of a predatory use of

1174
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:25,359
the natural human tendency to have these biases.

1175
00:44:27,440 --> 00:44:30,559
But my purpose in this talk is to try to

1176
00:44:30,560 --> 00:44:33,279
get you to think about ways you could

1177
00:44:33,280 --> 00:44:36,239
be aware of this.  So, as you continue on

1178
00:44:36,240 --> 00:44:37,598
in your education

1179
00:44:37,599 --> 00:44:39,199
in the crypto space, you're aware of

1180
00:44:39,200 --> 00:44:41,358
these biases -- both in yourself

1181
00:44:41,359 --> 00:44:43,679
and in other people that you talk with.

1182
00:44:43,680 --> 00:44:45,279
All right, so I was saying that these

1183
00:44:45,280 --> 00:44:47,118
biases happen to quote-unquote smart

1184
00:44:47,119 --> 00:44:48,159
people, as well as

1185
00:44:48,160 --> 00:44:49,919
not-so-smart people, so here's the

1186
00:44:49,920 --> 00:44:51,679
example of Long-Term Capital Management.

1187
00:44:51,680 --> 00:44:52,959
This was a hedge fund

1188
00:44:52,960 --> 00:44:56,159
in Connecticut, also in the mid-90s,

1189
00:44:56,160 --> 00:44:58,959
and if you wanted [a] blue-ribbon panel of

1190
00:44:58,960 --> 00:45:00,559
smart people on your hedge fund,

1191
00:45:00,560 --> 00:45:02,879
this one had it.  This one had Scholes, you

1192
00:45:02,880 --> 00:45:04,639
might have heard of Black-Scholes, that is

1193
00:45:04,640 --> 00:45:07,759
the famous formula that was

1194
00:45:07,760 --> 00:45:11,679
derived by Scholes to determine a fair price for

1195
00:45:11,680 --> 00:45:15,838
options, and that was also a Nobel prize winning

1196
00:45:15,839 --> 00:45:18,479
innovation -- and so these gentlemen were

1197
00:45:18,480 --> 00:45:20,479
both on the board of directors.

1198
00:45:20,480 --> 00:45:22,239
And as you can see in the blue line, the

1199
00:45:22,240 --> 00:45:23,919
performance of this hedge fund

1200
00:45:23,920 --> 00:45:26,078
was fantastic for a while -- and then it

1201
00:45:26,079 --> 00:45:27,999
crashed.  And one of the things that they

1202
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:30,453
lost on was the Russian default

1203
00:45:30,455 --> 00:45:35,118
on Russian bonds that happened in mid-1998.

1204
00:45:35,119 --> 00:45:36,559
Long-term Capital Management

1205
00:45:36,560 --> 00:45:38,496
had the logic of the following:

1206
00:45:38,498 --> 00:45:39,598
the Russian [government]

1207
00:45:39,599 --> 00:45:41,999
owe money on these bonds that they paid,

1208
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:43,838
but these bonds were not denominated in

1209
00:45:43,839 --> 00:45:46,462
dollars, or euros, or whatever --

1210
00:45:46,464 --> 00:45:47,279
these bonds were

1211
00:45:47,280 --> 00:45:49,679
denominated in Russian rubles,

1212
00:45:49,680 --> 00:45:51,279
and the Russians had the printing

1213
00:45:51,280 --> 00:45:53,838
presses to their own rubles --

1214
00:45:53,839 --> 00:45:56,318
so what's the probability that the

1215
00:45:56,319 --> 00:45:57,039
Russians are going to

1216
00:45:57,040 --> 00:45:58,559
default on those bonds, it's got to be

1217
00:45:58,560 --> 00:46:01,358
zero, because they own the printing presses

1218
00:46:01,359 --> 00:46:03,519
to the thing that they have to pay back.

1219
00:46:03,520 --> 00:46:05,358
It's kind of as if you had a

1220
00:46:05,359 --> 00:46:06,799
mortgage on your house

1221
00:46:06,800 --> 00:46:09,039
and to pay back the mortgage, you were

1222
00:46:09,040 --> 00:46:10,799
allowed to pay it back with "Monopoly

1223
00:46:10,800 --> 00:46:12,239
money" that you printed out on your

1224
00:46:12,240 --> 00:46:13,199
inkjet printer --

1225
00:46:13,200 --> 00:46:15,358
it's the same situation.  So, of course, why

1226
00:46:15,359 --> 00:46:17,118
would they default -- and it turns out they

1227
00:46:17,119 --> 00:46:18,078
defaulted.

1228
00:46:18,079 --> 00:46:21,358
So, this was a case of oversimplifying a probability

1229
00:46:21,359 --> 00:46:22,959
they thought of the probability of

1230
00:46:22,960 --> 00:46:25,039
default as being so small it was

1231
00:46:25,040 --> 00:46:27,438
negligible and they rounded it down to zero

1232
00:46:27,440 --> 00:46:28,626
when they shouldn't have.

1233
00:46:28,628 --> 00:46:31,679
So, this happens to everybody --

1234
00:46:31,680 --> 00:46:34,678
but not you, because you're watching this talk.

1235
00:46:35,359 --> 00:46:36,967
How can you apply this in crypto?

1236
00:46:36,969 --> 00:46:38,799
so, in crypto, there's a lot of "FUD" --

1237
00:46:38,800 --> 00:46:41,039
F-U-D, and that stands for fear, uncertainty

1238
00:46:41,040 --> 00:46:42,879
and doubt.

1239
00:46:42,880 --> 00:46:46,318
And so this is basically slander that

1240
00:46:46,319 --> 00:46:48,479
often comes out against one crypto

1241
00:46:48,480 --> 00:46:49,679
project or another.

1242
00:46:49,680 --> 00:46:52,159
And, part of your job as you navigate

1243
00:46:52,160 --> 00:46:54,078
cryptocurrency is to make sense of this --

1244
00:46:54,079 --> 00:46:55,279
what are you going to do with it?

1245
00:46:55,280 --> 00:46:56,455
you can't just ignore it,

1246
00:46:56,457 --> 00:46:58,159
you have to evaluate it somehow --

1247
00:46:58,160 --> 00:47:00,078
but often times these are things that are

1248
00:47:00,079 --> 00:47:01,519
difficult to prove,

1249
00:47:01,520 --> 00:47:04,506
and, so, what are you going to do?

1250
00:47:04,508 --> 00:47:05,598
What you want to do

1251
00:47:05,599 --> 00:47:07,759
is be aware that you're going to have an

1252
00:47:07,760 --> 00:47:09,439
innate tendency

1253
00:47:09,440 --> 00:47:12,639
to say, "eh... won't happen" or

1254
00:47:12,640 --> 00:47:15,039
"oh yeah, that's going to happen" or "eh...

1255
00:47:15,040 --> 00:47:16,559
it's a coin flip, it might happen."

1256
00:47:16,560 --> 00:47:18,159
That's going to be your tendency.

1257
00:47:18,160 --> 00:47:21,118
You need to be aware of that.  Because

1258
00:47:21,119 --> 00:47:22,345
if you give in to that --

1259
00:47:22,347 --> 00:47:24,558
that can be an expensive decision

1260
00:47:24,559 --> 00:47:27,519
because the actual probabilities matter.

1261
00:47:27,520 --> 00:47:31,759
The fair value of any asset is the sum

1262
00:47:31,760 --> 00:47:34,239
of the probability of every possible

1263
00:47:34,240 --> 00:47:35,199
future outcome

1264
00:47:35,200 --> 00:47:37,876
times that future value.

1265
00:47:37,877 --> 00:47:39,999
Know that you're going to tend to oversimplify the

1266
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:42,159
probability, and resist that impulse.

1267
00:47:42,160 --> 00:47:43,759
And you should also know that because

1268
00:47:43,760 --> 00:47:45,439
it's fear, uncertainty, and doubt, they're

1269
00:47:45,440 --> 00:47:49,272
designed to trigger that loss impulse in your mind,

1270
00:47:49,274 --> 00:47:51,597
so it's going to get magnified in your brain.

1271
00:47:51,599 --> 00:47:54,318
So, I would say to try to think about it

1272
00:47:54,319 --> 00:47:55,999
clinically, think about it objectively,

1273
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:56,879
think of it like

1274
00:47:56,880 --> 00:47:58,879
some sort of math problem that your

1275
00:47:58,880 --> 00:48:00,799
challenge is to estimate the probability

1276
00:48:00,800 --> 00:48:02,815
of some event happening.

1277
00:48:04,128 --> 00:48:06,940
As a example for this, I would like to

1278
00:48:06,942 --> 00:48:08,884
talk about --

1279
00:48:08,885 --> 00:48:11,279
and I saw this in the chat earlier --

1280
00:48:11,280 --> 00:48:12,879
what's the probability that the whole

1281
00:48:12,880 --> 00:48:14,399
world bans Monero?

1282
00:48:14,400 --> 00:48:16,239
Now, so we saw an interesting talk from

1283
00:48:16,240 --> 00:48:18,763
Justin [Ehrenhofer] earlier that had

1284
00:48:18,765 --> 00:48:20,959
kind of a takeaway message that

1285
00:48:20,960 --> 00:48:23,838
it's not obvious that a given country --

1286
00:48:23,839 --> 00:48:25,439
for example, the United States --

1287
00:48:25,440 --> 00:48:28,639
will want to ban Monero from centralized

1288
00:48:28,640 --> 00:48:30,959
exchanges, because then it's going to lose a bunch

1289
00:48:30,960 --> 00:48:33,279
of information that it would have otherwise

1290
00:48:33,280 --> 00:48:35,759
been able to access, by being able to

1291
00:48:35,760 --> 00:48:36,826
regulate that exchange.

1292
00:48:36,828 --> 00:48:39,358
If it bans it, then all the trading is going to

1293
00:48:39,359 --> 00:48:41,279
go to forums that it has

1294
00:48:41,280 --> 00:48:42,936
no information in.

1295
00:48:42,938 --> 00:48:44,719
So, it actually might be

1296
00:48:44,720 --> 00:48:48,239
in the best interest of a given government

1297
00:48:48,240 --> 00:48:50,758
to allow it.

1298
00:48:50,760 --> 00:48:52,799
So now I want to take that one [step] further,

1299
00:48:52,800 --> 00:48:55,118
I want to look at the entire world, right?

1300
00:48:55,119 --> 00:48:57,805
So, [an] effective worldwide ban

1301
00:48:57,806 --> 00:49:00,303
would need to be coordinated, globally.

1302
00:49:00,305 --> 00:49:02,320
It wouldn't really work for one country to say,

1303
00:49:02,322 --> 00:49:03,521
"OK, we're going [to ban] Monero"

1304
00:49:03,523 --> 00:49:05,460
and everyone else is like "yeah, whatever,

1305
00:49:05,462 --> 00:49:08,679
it's still cool here."  [That's] not much of a ban.

1306
00:49:08,681 --> 00:49:09,519
You have to have

1307
00:49:09,520 --> 00:49:11,118
everyone, like, on board, right?

1308
00:49:11,119 --> 00:49:13,519
You've got to coordinate this, and then on

1309
00:49:13,520 --> 00:49:15,838
some day you've got to be like "OK, we

1310
00:49:15,839 --> 00:49:17,519
world governments have all come to the

1311
00:49:17,520 --> 00:49:18,959
conclusion that we're doing this ban."

1312
00:49:18,960 --> 00:49:21,118
All the important countries would

1313
00:49:21,119 --> 00:49:22,959
need to participate.

1314
00:49:22,960 --> 00:49:25,039
So certainly, you'd think of the big ones --

1315
00:49:25,040 --> 00:49:26,719
the US, the Eurozone,

1316
00:49:26,720 --> 00:49:29,759
China and Russia.  So, immediately,

1317
00:49:29,760 --> 00:49:33,358
here are four countries that don't have

1318
00:49:33,359 --> 00:49:35,279
[a] consistent record in all getting along

1319
00:49:35,280 --> 00:49:37,759
and singing Kumbaya on anything.

1320
00:49:37,760 --> 00:49:40,078
But, beyond that -- each of these countries

1321
00:49:40,079 --> 00:49:41,039
has to choose,

1322
00:49:41,040 --> 00:49:44,078
"ban" or "no ban."  Each country,

1323
00:49:44,079 --> 00:49:46,719
as a sovereign unit, they get to choose,

1324
00:49:46,720 --> 00:49:49,039
"do we cooperate in this worldwide ban, or

1325
00:49:49,040 --> 00:49:50,799
do we not cooperate?"

1326
00:49:50,800 --> 00:49:53,837
So, the cooperating option I’m putting in green,

1327
00:49:53,839 --> 00:49:55,519
and the non-cooperative option, I’m

1328
00:49:55,520 --> 00:49:57,439
putting in red.  So if everyone in the

1329
00:49:57,440 --> 00:49:58,558
world bans it,

1330
00:49:58,559 --> 00:50:00,159
all the world governments -- OK, they say,

1331
00:50:00,160 --> 00:50:02,318
"hooray, no more Monero."

1332
00:50:02,319 --> 00:50:05,118
However, let's say one or more countries

1333
00:50:05,119 --> 00:50:07,309
do not go along with this scheme

1334
00:50:07,311 --> 00:50:09,118
and they elect to not ban.

1335
00:50:09,119 --> 00:50:11,479
So, they say "no ban."  What's going to happen?

1336
00:50:11,481 --> 00:50:12,879
Then, the countries that did a

1337
00:50:12,880 --> 00:50:13,759
"no-ban" --

1338
00:50:13,760 --> 00:50:16,239
they're going to get an incoming influx

1339
00:50:16,240 --> 00:50:17,519
of brain power

1340
00:50:17,520 --> 00:50:19,838
working on this form of fungible,

1341
00:50:19,839 --> 00:50:22,318
decentralized, digital value.

1342
00:50:22,319 --> 00:50:25,439
Now, all of a sudden -- maybe this is

1343
00:50:25,440 --> 00:50:27,517
not what the "ban" people were thinking.

1344
00:50:27,519 --> 00:50:29,199
They were not intending

1345
00:50:29,200 --> 00:50:32,078
for a reward in global innovation

1346
00:50:32,079 --> 00:50:34,557
to go to the countries that were not cooperating.

1347
00:50:34,559 --> 00:50:37,337
And yet this is a classic problem in game theory.

1348
00:50:37,339 --> 00:50:39,278
it's called the prisoner's dilemma problem.

1349
00:50:39,280 --> 00:50:40,799
The prisoner's dilemma problem goes like

1350
00:50:40,800 --> 00:50:42,959
this:  you have two suspects,

1351
00:50:42,960 --> 00:50:44,879
and they've been captured by the police,

1352
00:50:44,880 --> 00:50:46,239
and they've been detained,

1353
00:50:46,240 --> 00:50:48,239
and now they're being interrogated in

1354
00:50:48,240 --> 00:50:49,999
separate rooms, so they can't talk to

1355
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:50,799
each other.

1356
00:50:50,800 --> 00:50:54,399
So, you have "perp 1" and "perp 2."

1357
00:50:54,400 --> 00:50:58,639
Each of these detained people can decide:

1358
00:50:58,640 --> 00:51:00,799
am I going to rat on the other guy?  Am I

1359
00:51:00,800 --> 00:51:02,159
going to tell the police that the other

1360
00:51:02,160 --> 00:51:03,358
guy did it?

1361
00:51:03,359 --> 00:51:05,759
Or, am I going to keep my mouth shut, and

1362
00:51:05,760 --> 00:51:09,338
not betray my "partner in crime" here --

1363
00:51:09,340 --> 00:51:12,878
that's the decision that each of these people have.

1364
00:51:12,880 --> 00:51:14,879
What is the outcome based on what they

1365
00:51:14,880 --> 00:51:16,719
do?  So, if neither of these

1366
00:51:16,720 --> 00:51:19,358
suspects rat, then they both go free,

1367
00:51:19,359 --> 00:51:21,039
because the police didn't get any

1368
00:51:21,040 --> 00:51:22,959
confessions out of any [of them.]

1369
00:51:22,960 --> 00:51:25,279
If they both rat on each other, they both

1370
00:51:25,280 --> 00:51:27,439
stay in jail.

1371
00:51:27,440 --> 00:51:29,519
The interesting situation happens if one

1372
00:51:29,520 --> 00:51:30,479
of the guys

1373
00:51:30,480 --> 00:51:33,679
decides to betray his chum, but the other

1374
00:51:33,680 --> 00:51:36,399
guy does not choose to betray.  That is,

1375
00:51:36,400 --> 00:51:38,799
"rat" and "no rat."  What happens then?

1376
00:51:38,800 --> 00:51:41,759
Then the "dishonorable" person -- the rat --

1377
00:51:41,760 --> 00:51:43,279
gets to go free,

1378
00:51:43,280 --> 00:51:46,318
because his buddy didn't blame him --

1379
00:51:46,319 --> 00:51:49,118
he gets to go free.  The guy who was

1380
00:51:49,119 --> 00:51:50,399
actually doing the quote unquote

1381
00:51:50,400 --> 00:51:51,439
honorable thing,

1382
00:51:51,440 --> 00:51:53,598
by sticking with his teammate -- he's going

1383
00:51:53,599 --> 00:51:54,799
to stay in jail.

1384
00:51:54,800 --> 00:51:57,519
This is called the prisoner's dilemma.

1385
00:51:57,520 --> 00:51:59,679
OK, so I’m pointing out that a global

1386
00:51:59,680 --> 00:52:01,199
ban on Monero is kind of like the

1387
00:52:01,200 --> 00:52:02,239
prisoner's dilemma --

1388
00:52:02,240 --> 00:52:04,558
but is there any more real world data

1389
00:52:04,559 --> 00:52:06,383
that we can use

1390
00:52:06,384 --> 00:52:09,039
to put a little more light on this question?

1391
00:52:09,040 --> 00:52:11,598
And the answer is yes -- it turns out that

1392
00:52:11,599 --> 00:52:13,519
in the 90s,

1393
00:52:13,520 --> 00:52:17,038
there was a game show called "Golden Balls."

1394
00:52:17,040 --> 00:52:18,719
You can go on YouTube and watch some

1395
00:52:18,720 --> 00:52:20,558
episodes of this -- but basically, the

1396
00:52:20,559 --> 00:52:23,039
end of every episode of "Golden Balls" was

1397
00:52:23,040 --> 00:52:24,558
a prisoner's dilemma.

1398
00:52:24,559 --> 00:52:29,118
You have two finalists, and each one can choose:

1399
00:52:29,119 --> 00:52:32,879
"do I steal the jackpot, or do I split the jackpot?"

1400
00:52:32,880 --> 00:52:35,039
And the jackpot [size would] vary, it was usually

1401
00:52:35,040 --> 00:52:37,926
1,000 to 100,000 British pounds,

1402
00:52:37,928 --> 00:52:41,438
so that'd be like 2,000 to 200,000 US dollars,

1403
00:52:41,440 --> 00:52:42,719
although towards the end of that period,

1404
00:52:42,720 --> 00:52:45,758
it would have been 1,500 to 150,000 US dollars --

1405
00:52:45,760 --> 00:52:48,719
so basically, if the two contestants

1406
00:52:48,720 --> 00:52:50,479
agree to be nice to each other --

1407
00:52:50,480 --> 00:52:53,118
if they go "split" ["split"] -- then each contestant

1408
00:52:53,119 --> 00:52:55,039
wins half the money.

1409
00:52:55,040 --> 00:52:57,199
If one person is dishonorable, and

1410
00:52:57,200 --> 00:52:58,318
chooses to steal,

1411
00:52:58,319 --> 00:53:00,479
but the other person is nice, then the

1412
00:53:00,480 --> 00:53:02,479
stealer wins all the money,

1413
00:53:02,480 --> 00:53:05,118
the nice person gets nothing.  And if they

1414
00:53:05,119 --> 00:53:06,318
both choose to steal,

1415
00:53:06,319 --> 00:53:08,558
the TV show keeps the entire jackpot.

1416
00:53:08,559 --> 00:53:10,078
And, so, a picture being worth a thousand

1417
00:53:10,079 --> 00:53:12,239
words, these are very entertaining --

1418
00:53:12,240 --> 00:53:14,799
here are two ladies, and they both said

1419
00:53:14,800 --> 00:53:15,679
they were going to "split" --

1420
00:53:15,680 --> 00:53:17,919
and so they both go home winners,

1421
00:53:17,920 --> 00:53:19,279
it's like a daughter and mother

1422
00:53:19,280 --> 00:53:21,519
finding the daughter and the mother that

1423
00:53:21,520 --> 00:53:23,661
they never had, all of a sudden --

1424
00:53:23,663 --> 00:53:26,718
a very heartwarming moment.

1425
00:53:26,720 --> 00:53:29,199
Here's one where the woman on the left

1426
00:53:29,200 --> 00:53:31,838
has chosen to steal the entire jackpot

1427
00:53:31,839 --> 00:53:34,078
from the shell-shocked man on the right

1428
00:53:34,079 --> 00:53:36,533
who is revealing that his decision was [to] split --

1429
00:53:36,535 --> 00:53:38,718
they have these golden balls, one has the

1430
00:53:38,720 --> 00:53:40,625
word "steal" and one has the word "split" in it,

1431
00:53:40,627 --> 00:53:41,519
so that's one

1432
00:53:41,520 --> 00:53:44,799
source of the name "Golden Balls" --

1433
00:53:44,800 --> 00:53:47,118
so the look of betrayal and shock on

1434
00:53:47,119 --> 00:53:48,719
the guy who is nice, but now is going

1435
00:53:48,720 --> 00:53:50,318
to go home with nothing,

1436
00:53:50,319 --> 00:53:52,795
contrasts with the... well, of course,

1437
00:53:52,797 --> 00:53:54,764
she's jumping up and down inside,

1438
00:53:54,766 --> 00:53:56,718
because she stole the entire jackpot, but

1439
00:53:56,720 --> 00:53:59,199
on the downside, she's being exposed on

1440
00:53:59,200 --> 00:54:00,558
national TV as being

1441
00:54:00,559 --> 00:54:03,759
somewhat of a twit -- and is finding it

1442
00:54:03,760 --> 00:54:06,399
difficult to look this guy in the eye.

1443
00:54:06,400 --> 00:54:09,519
And then here, we have a case of two stealers --

1444
00:54:09,520 --> 00:54:11,838
here you can see that they were both

1445
00:54:11,839 --> 00:54:13,598
revealing that they were planning to

1446
00:54:13,599 --> 00:54:15,039
stab each other in the back

1447
00:54:15,040 --> 00:54:18,879
and the faces kind of say a lot.

1448
00:54:18,880 --> 00:54:21,999
So that's all very entertaining -- but

1449
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:23,759
what's really fascinating was that there

1450
00:54:23,760 --> 00:54:26,719
was an academic paper that studied

1451
00:54:26,720 --> 00:54:31,117
all of the 150 final rounds of "Golden Balls,"

1452
00:54:31,119 --> 00:54:33,358
and they did an analysis:  what makes the

1453
00:54:33,359 --> 00:54:35,598
contestants more likely to cooperate

1454
00:54:35,599 --> 00:54:37,519
versus not cooperate?

1455
00:54:37,520 --> 00:54:39,199
And so the key result from this paper

1456
00:54:39,200 --> 00:54:40,959
I’m showing here, is this:

1457
00:54:40,960 --> 00:54:43,838
that as the jackpot went up -- so that's

1458
00:54:43,839 --> 00:54:46,239
the horizontal axis on this plot, so

1459
00:54:46,240 --> 00:54:48,479
as you go from 100 pounds to 1,000

1460
00:54:48,480 --> 00:54:49,679
pounds to a 100,000 pounds,

1461
00:54:49,680 --> 00:54:51,358
you're going to the right --

1462
00:54:51,359 --> 00:54:53,279
and then on the vertical axis, this is

1463
00:54:53,280 --> 00:54:54,959
the probability that the two

1464
00:54:54,960 --> 00:54:56,959
contestants were nice to each other, and

1465
00:54:56,960 --> 00:54:59,708
did a "chop chop," a "split split" of the pot --

1466
00:54:59,710 --> 00:55:01,598
and both went home happy.

1467
00:55:01,599 --> 00:55:02,639
You can see when the

1468
00:55:02,640 --> 00:55:04,558
pot was like, 10 pounds, they're like,

1469
00:55:04,559 --> 00:55:06,239
"yeah, OK, we'll just split it" right?

1470
00:55:06,240 --> 00:55:08,399
It's not worth looking like a jerk on

1471
00:55:08,400 --> 00:55:10,879
national TV -- but once you get into the

1472
00:55:10,880 --> 00:55:13,199
quote-unquote life-changing amounts of

1473
00:55:13,200 --> 00:55:14,719
100,000 pounds --

1474
00:55:14,720 --> 00:55:16,639
now, the probability that each one is

1475
00:55:16,640 --> 00:55:18,798
going to go home with half of it goes down

1476
00:55:18,799 --> 00:55:22,399
because they observe that if they're greedy

1477
00:55:22,400 --> 00:55:25,920
they could go home with even more.

1478
00:55:26,480 --> 00:55:28,719
What does this inform us with the

1479
00:55:28,720 --> 00:55:30,159
prisoner's dilemma problem,

1480
00:55:30,160 --> 00:55:32,078
as applied to a global ban on

1481
00:55:32,079 --> 00:55:34,159
cryptocurrency?  It is that as the

1482
00:55:34,160 --> 00:55:37,118
perceived value of cryptocurrency increases,

1483
00:55:37,119 --> 00:55:40,159
a global ban is going to become less likely,

1484
00:55:40,160 --> 00:55:42,239
because any country that doesn't

1485
00:55:42,240 --> 00:55:43,679
cooperate with the ban

1486
00:55:43,680 --> 00:55:45,577
is going to capture

1487
00:55:45,579 --> 00:55:47,439
more of the economic value

1488
00:55:47,440 --> 00:55:50,719
that comes with being a beacon of freedom

1489
00:55:50,720 --> 00:55:53,519
that would allow, basically, smart geeks

1490
00:55:53,520 --> 00:55:57,118
to come settle in, and help build this new

1491
00:55:57,119 --> 00:56:00,879
economy with this efficient new form of money.

1492
00:56:00,880 --> 00:56:04,798
So basically, since the price of crypto

1493
00:56:04,799 --> 00:56:07,598
keeps getting more valuable, this is

1494
00:56:07,599 --> 00:56:09,679
saying that game theoretically, a global

1495
00:56:09,680 --> 00:56:13,839
ban becomes less likely as time goes on.

1496
00:56:15,440 --> 00:56:16,558
All right, so there are a lot more

1497
00:56:16,559 --> 00:56:20,018
examples of things like this, but I'll stop here.

1498
00:56:20,020 --> 00:56:22,639
Here's my summary of behavioral crypto.

1499
00:56:22,640 --> 00:56:25,675
Market prices are not always correct.

1500
00:56:25,677 --> 00:56:26,941
You should keep that in mind.

1501
00:56:26,943 --> 00:56:28,639
Market prices are not always correct.

1502
00:56:28,640 --> 00:56:30,798
Especially for any widely misunderstood

1503
00:56:30,799 --> 00:56:32,639
new technology --

1504
00:56:32,640 --> 00:56:35,318
in 1993, that was the Internet --

1505
00:56:35,320 --> 00:56:37,199
it's happening again now.

1506
00:56:37,200 --> 00:56:39,439
One question that is unresolved that

1507
00:56:39,440 --> 00:56:41,439
happened in the dot com era:

1508
00:56:41,440 --> 00:56:43,919
in the dot com era, there was kind of a

1509
00:56:43,920 --> 00:56:45,679
battle that was forming between two

1510
00:56:45,680 --> 00:56:47,679
visions of what the Internet would be.

1511
00:56:47,680 --> 00:56:51,118
One was a "Wild West" of the open Internet,

1512
00:56:51,119 --> 00:56:52,719
in which you could just get on with a

1513
00:56:52,720 --> 00:56:55,759
browser, and type whatever you wanted

1514
00:56:55,760 --> 00:56:57,679
in the address bar, and it would take you

1515
00:56:57,680 --> 00:57:00,159
there.  That was just "Wild West"

1516
00:57:00,160 --> 00:57:02,239
because anyone could put up a website,

1517
00:57:02,240 --> 00:57:03,759
anyone could do whatever they want,

1518
00:57:03,760 --> 00:57:05,519
and anyone was free to go wherever

1519
00:57:05,520 --> 00:57:07,118
they want -- that was like this

1520
00:57:07,119 --> 00:57:09,504
crazy world that was envisioned.

1521
00:57:09,506 --> 00:57:10,639
That was kind of one

1522
00:57:10,640 --> 00:57:12,642
direction that the Internet could have gone.

1523
00:57:12,644 --> 00:57:13,999
The other was

1524
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:16,627
exemplified by a company called America Online,

1525
00:57:16,629 --> 00:57:19,118
AOL, and what they offered was a "walled

1526
00:57:19,119 --> 00:57:20,798
garden" sort of experience.

1527
00:57:20,799 --> 00:57:22,558
So basically, you would not be on the

1528
00:57:22,559 --> 00:57:25,039
Internet if you were an AOL customer.

1529
00:57:25,040 --> 00:57:28,399
You would be on AOL's curated version of

1530
00:57:28,400 --> 00:57:30,798
the Internet:  "OK, I’m going to take away

1531
00:57:30,799 --> 00:57:32,798
your Mozilla web browser, and I’m just

1532
00:57:32,799 --> 00:57:34,239
going to give you this other app,

1533
00:57:34,240 --> 00:57:35,598
and you'll be able to choose

1534
00:57:35,599 --> 00:57:38,239
websites that we... approved... for you,

1535
00:57:38,240 --> 00:57:40,501
you'll be happy with it, you'll like it" --

1536
00:57:40,503 --> 00:57:41,679
people didn't want it.

1537
00:57:41,680 --> 00:57:44,318
People wanted the wide open Wild West.

1538
00:57:44,319 --> 00:57:46,159
But we're in a point in crypto that is

1539
00:57:46,160 --> 00:57:48,798
very like that crossroads that was in the

1540
00:57:48,799 --> 00:57:50,842
internet in the mid-90s:

1541
00:57:50,844 --> 00:57:52,558
that is, do we want an open

1542
00:57:52,559 --> 00:57:54,479
blockchain, you have a Wild West

1543
00:57:54,480 --> 00:57:56,159
of different projects out there with

1544
00:57:56,160 --> 00:57:57,838
different ethos?

1545
00:57:57,839 --> 00:58:00,639
Or do you have AOL -- so you would go to a

1546
00:58:00,640 --> 00:58:03,279
custodian, and the custodian would take care of all

1547
00:58:03,280 --> 00:58:05,598
these crypto choices for you, and they'd

1548
00:58:05,599 --> 00:58:07,118
serve it up to you on a

1549
00:58:07,119 --> 00:58:10,159
sanitized little platter that you could then click

1550
00:58:10,160 --> 00:58:13,039
and choose from.  So, we're in a similar

1551
00:58:13,040 --> 00:58:14,159
situation now -- it's not

1552
00:58:14,160 --> 00:58:17,280
really clear what's going to win.

1553
00:58:17,440 --> 00:58:20,318
All right, so part of behavioral

1554
00:58:20,319 --> 00:58:22,318
economics is the observation that people

1555
00:58:22,319 --> 00:58:23,598
tend to overemphasize

1556
00:58:23,599 --> 00:58:26,639
losses compared to gains.

1557
00:58:26,640 --> 00:58:28,558
They also tend to oversimplify

1558
00:58:28,559 --> 00:58:30,558
probabilities into three buckets:

1559
00:58:30,559 --> 00:58:33,045
"yes," "no," and "maybe."

1560
00:58:33,047 --> 00:58:35,598
"Smart" people have these biases too.

1561
00:58:35,599 --> 00:58:38,878
It's funny, if you look at the

1562
00:58:38,880 --> 00:58:42,078
general tenor of people's tweets or

1563
00:58:42,079 --> 00:58:45,198
whatever, they tend to get more and more

1564
00:58:45,200 --> 00:58:46,879
confident and then more and more

1565
00:58:46,880 --> 00:58:48,959
arrogant as the price goes up.

1566
00:58:48,960 --> 00:58:53,998
So, currently the price of Bitcoin's been up.

1567
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:56,239
Over time, these mispricing biases tend

1568
00:58:56,240 --> 00:58:57,598
to resolve.  That is,

1569
00:58:57,599 --> 00:58:59,919
even though there can be temporary

1570
00:58:59,920 --> 00:59:04,239
dispositions in the "true" price versus a

1571
00:59:04,240 --> 00:59:07,279
market price, these tend to go away over time.

1572
00:59:07,280 --> 00:59:08,616
That is,

1573
00:59:08,618 --> 00:59:11,199
if you know that other people are biased,

1574
00:59:11,200 --> 00:59:13,759
and they're making estimates of

1575
00:59:13,760 --> 00:59:16,798
valuation based on biased estimators,

1576
00:59:16,799 --> 00:59:18,159
you know that they're biased and you

1577
00:59:18,160 --> 00:59:20,798
think you have a better version of it --

1578
00:59:20,799 --> 00:59:23,576
if you're right, that's an investing strategy.

1579
00:59:23,578 --> 00:59:26,357
In fact, we call this value investing.

1580
00:59:26,359 --> 00:59:28,701
This is exemplified by Benjamin Graham,

1581
00:59:28,703 --> 00:59:30,988
whose quote I read earlier,

1582
00:59:30,990 --> 00:59:32,879
but [of] course the most famous

1583
00:59:32,880 --> 00:59:34,558
proponent of this style of investing is

1584
00:59:34,559 --> 00:59:36,078
Warren Buffett.

1585
00:59:36,079 --> 00:59:38,078
Basically, what Warren Buffett does is he

1586
00:59:38,079 --> 00:59:41,919
looks for companies that nobody cares about,

1587
00:59:41,920 --> 00:59:43,199
they've been forgotten,

1588
00:59:43,200 --> 00:59:45,439
they're doing something that's not sexy,

1589
00:59:45,440 --> 00:59:48,090
they're doing something that's all fuddy-duddy,

1590
00:59:48,092 --> 00:59:50,719
not very exciting -- and

1591
00:59:50,720 --> 00:59:53,468
he sees that their prices are low, and

1592
00:59:53,470 --> 00:59:58,079
and he loads up on them, and he waits.

1593
00:59:58,799 --> 01:00:00,726
All right, so that's all I have --

1594
01:00:00,728 --> 01:00:02,959
put the earphones back in...

1595
01:00:02,960 --> 01:00:05,118
if you'd like to get in touch with me --

1596
01:00:05,119 --> 01:00:06,350
if you're looking for, maybe,

1597
01:00:06,352 --> 01:00:09,039
a Sherpa who can help you

1598
01:00:09,040 --> 01:00:11,279
kind of align your strategy with

1599
01:00:11,280 --> 01:00:12,719
principles based on

1600
01:00:12,720 --> 01:00:15,039
academic finance but also based on real

1601
01:00:15,040 --> 01:00:16,558
world experience --

1602
01:00:16,559 --> 01:00:19,358
also, a solid connection, like I mentioned

1603
01:00:19,359 --> 01:00:22,239
before, between the worlds of

1604
01:00:22,240 --> 01:00:24,959
open-source, cypherpunk cryptocurrencies

1605
01:00:24,960 --> 01:00:26,558
and the more traditional

1606
01:00:26,559 --> 01:00:28,558
aspects of wealth management, estate

1607
01:00:28,559 --> 01:00:30,239
planning, trusts --

1608
01:00:30,240 --> 01:00:32,719
so trusts are a potential way that you

1609
01:00:32,720 --> 01:00:35,039
can change the jurisdiction of your assets,

1610
01:00:35,040 --> 01:00:39,118
in a 100 percent legal and upfront way --

1611
01:00:39,119 --> 01:00:41,199
things like this are what I can help my

1612
01:00:41,200 --> 01:00:45,506
clients with.  So -- that's it, thanks.
