00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:02,277
Soy el Dr. Daniel Kim, Fundador y CEO de

2
00:00:02,278 --> 00:00:04,290
Sweetwater Digital Asset Consulting.

3
00:00:04,637 --> 00:00:05,656
Esta charla se titula

4
00:00:05,657 --> 00:00:08,399
"Dinero Sólido, Modo Seguro" y es una

5
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:10,168
introducción amplia y general

6
00:00:10,169 --> 00:00:12,193
a las criptomonedas y a Monero.

7
00:00:12,559 --> 00:00:15,220
Un poco acerca de mi -- as� que, acad�micamente,

8
00:00:15,221 --> 00:00:16,836
I'm trained as a particle physicist --

9
00:00:16,847 --> 00:00:19,015
I did my undergraduate and graduate work

10
00:00:19,026 --> 00:00:21,349
en f�sica experimental de part�culas en Harvard.

11
00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:23,495
All�, ten�a un h�bito arraigado en m�

12
00:00:23,506 --> 00:00:24,710
de mirar siempre los datos,

13
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:26,373
as� que va a haber un mont�n de datos

14
00:00:26,374 --> 00:00:27,433
mostrados en esta charla.

15
00:00:27,717 --> 00:00:28,708
La mayor parte de mi carrera la

16
00:00:28,709 --> 00:00:30,421
pas� en el sector sin fines de lucro.

17
00:00:30,422 --> 00:00:32,262
Mi primer trabajo al salir de la escuela de posgrado fue con una

18
00:00:32,263 --> 00:00:34,229
orquesta sinf�nica, donde termin� haciendo unos

19
00:00:34,239 --> 00:00:35,875
700 conciertos profesionalmente --

20
00:00:35,886 --> 00:00:38,402
primero como violinista y luego como teclista.

21
00:00:38,836 --> 00:00:39,851
Simult�neamente con eso,

22
00:00:39,862 --> 00:00:41,420
tuve que hacer mucho esfuerzo para obtener

23
00:00:41,421 --> 00:00:43,560
la certificaci�n de la junta en f�sica de oncolog�a de radiaci�n.

24
00:00:43,663 --> 00:00:45,590
Luego, como profesor de la escuela de medicina en

25
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:47,046
f�sica m�dica, ayud� alrededor de

26
00:00:47,047 --> 00:00:48,950
un par de miles de pacientes con su

27
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:51,146
lucha contra el c�ncer, ayudando con

28
00:00:51,147 --> 00:00:53,063
los aspectos t�cnicos de la administraci�n

29
00:00:53,074 --> 00:00:54,578
de radiaci�n de alta intensidad.

30
00:00:54,803 --> 00:00:56,801
Fue como profesor de la escuela de medicina que yo

31
00:00:56,812 --> 00:00:58,752
hice lo que quiz�s sea mi cosa m�s "DEF CON",

32
00:00:58,753 --> 00:01:00,869
que fu� inventar un dispositivo

33
00:01:00,879 --> 00:01:02,470
que analizaba paquetes

34
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:05,030
en una red m�dica para reconstruir

35
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:07,350
datos de los tratamientos que se entregaban a los

36
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:09,841
patients just before the time of treatment.

37
00:01:10,144 --> 00:01:11,830
Me inscrib� para el programa de MBA Ejecutivo

38
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:13,830
en Yale porque pens� que

39
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:16,679
quer�a mostrar un inter�s en la forma

40
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:17,670
en que el mundo funciona

41
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:19,749
de una manera diferente a la f�sica.

42
00:01:19,916 --> 00:01:21,270
Por supuesto, en la f�sica, est�s llegando a c�mo

43
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:23,068
funciona el mundo en los niveles m�s peque�os,

44
00:01:23,199 --> 00:01:25,396
pero luego pensar ampliamente sobre los problemas humanos

45
00:01:25,397 --> 00:01:27,429
del "mundo real" desde una variedad de

46
00:01:27,439 --> 00:01:29,590
perspectivas, el MBA es bueno para eso.

47
00:01:29,718 --> 00:01:31,749
Mientras hac�a eso, hice un cambio al

48
00:01:31,759 --> 00:01:32,796
sector con fines de lucro --

49
00:01:32,807 --> 00:01:35,030
me un� a un peque�o fondo de inversi�n y me convert�

50
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:36,469
en Director de Investigaci�n all�.

51
00:01:36,479 --> 00:01:38,789
Fui co-autor de un trabajo que gan�

52
00:01:38,799 --> 00:01:40,789
el premio de investigaci�n m�s importante del

53
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:43,590
Instituto CFA.  Ese trabajo era sobre el

54
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:46,069
efecto de la liquidez en los precios de los activos.

55
00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:47,910
En mi tiempo libre, me estaba interesando cada vez m�s y

56
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:49,830
m�s en las criptomonedas y

57
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:51,429
luego tom� la decisi�n de que

58
00:01:51,439 --> 00:01:53,056
se trataba de una innovaci�n genuina,

59
00:01:53,057 --> 00:01:54,652
de las que no hay muchas que ocurran

60
00:01:54,653 --> 00:01:56,230
en la vida de uno, as� que

61
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:58,389
salt� a mi propio peque�o negocio, que es

62
00:01:58,399 --> 00:02:00,870
lo que hago ahora como consultor independiente.

63
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:03,630
Ahora ayudo a crear un puente entre dos mundos muy separados

64
00:02:03,631 --> 00:02:05,286
como fundador y CEO de

65
00:02:05,287 --> 00:02:07,332
Sweetwater Digital Asset Consulting --

66
00:02:07,333 --> 00:02:09,378
est� el mundo que DEF CON

67
00:02:09,379 --> 00:02:10,469
representa, que es una

68
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:12,209
cultura no comercial, de c�digo abierto,

69
00:02:12,220 --> 00:02:13,750
cypherpunk, de base,

70
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:15,703
de criptomonedas --

71
00:02:15,714 --> 00:02:17,909
y en el lado derecho est� el

72
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:19,610
universo paralelo de

73
00:02:19,621 --> 00:02:21,350
la protecci�n tradicional de los activos,

74
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:23,610
la gesti�n del portafolio de fideicomisos y de la family office,

75
00:02:23,621 --> 00:02:25,110
planificaci�n patrimonial y fiscal.

76
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:27,249
Estos dos mundos separados saben

77
00:02:27,250 --> 00:02:29,183
muy poco el uno del otro, en la pr�ctica --

78
00:02:29,184 --> 00:02:30,835
a menudo hacen suposiciones sobre

79
00:02:30,836 --> 00:02:33,030
el otro que se basan en el miedo --

80
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:35,430
y as�, como alguien que tiene experiencia

81
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:37,670
significativa en ambos lados de esta divisi�n,

82
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:40,229
hablo con los chicos que son "OG" en cripto que quieren

83
00:02:40,239 --> 00:02:41,910
orientaci�n en la elaboraci�n de un plan

84
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:44,150
para proteger a sus criptomonedas de futuros

85
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:45,589
acreedores, ya sean

86
00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:48,150
personas al azar que podr�an demandarlos o un

87
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:51,408
futuro ex-c�nyugue potencialmente vengativo --

88
00:02:51,788 --> 00:02:53,247
y luego, desde la otra direcci�n,

89
00:02:53,258 --> 00:02:56,016
hablo con administradores de portafolios tradicionales

90
00:02:56,017 --> 00:02:58,288
en el mundo de los fideicomisos y las propiedades que est�n

91
00:02:58,289 --> 00:03:00,607
bien familiarizados con los activos tradicionales,

92
00:03:00,608 --> 00:03:02,186
han o�do hablar de este "asunto de la criptomoneda",

93
00:03:02,187 --> 00:03:03,439
quieren saber si es real,

94
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:05,670
y quieren ponerse en contacto con un Sherpa

95
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:08,650
que les ayude a ignorar la informaci�n confusa.

96
00:03:09,030 --> 00:03:11,067
In my non-profit efforts these days

97
00:03:11,078 --> 00:03:12,735
tambi�n soy un voluntario de la comunidad

98
00:03:12,746 --> 00:03:14,149
para el proyecto Monero.

99
00:03:14,159 --> 00:03:17,398
Mi charla aqu� es voluntaria.

100
00:03:17,399 --> 00:03:19,494
Estoy haciendo esto porque personalmente siento que

101
00:03:19,505 --> 00:03:21,545
este es un proyecto importante para la humanidad.

102
00:03:21,546 --> 00:03:23,589
Creo que es importante que la gente se

103
00:03:23,599 --> 00:03:25,750
exprese y haga o�r su voz

104
00:03:25,761 --> 00:03:27,268
en asuntos como �ste.

105
00:03:27,279 --> 00:03:28,626
No recibo ning�n

106
00:03:28,637 --> 00:03:30,147
apoyo del proyecto Monero,

107
00:03:30,158 --> 00:03:31,291
nunca he pedido apoyo

108
00:03:31,302 --> 00:03:32,493
del proyecto Monero --

109
00:03:32,504 --> 00:03:34,630
I want to maintain my independence, as my

110
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:37,430
primary duty is to my consulting clients,

111
00:03:37,563 --> 00:03:39,830
a los que debo el deber de hacer la

112
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:42,105
investigaci�n y la examinaci�n de

113
00:03:42,106 --> 00:03:43,679
todo el espacio de las criptomonedas

114
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:45,837
y hacer recomendaciones sobre lo que creo

115
00:03:45,848 --> 00:03:48,178
are the most compelling projects out there.

116
00:03:48,412 --> 00:03:50,390
Dentro de las criptomonedas, tambi�n me especializo

117
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:52,390
en tokens que hacen lo que creo que es la

118
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:54,597
"killer app" of Nakamoto consensus,

119
00:03:54,608 --> 00:03:56,017
que es el dinero.

120
00:03:56,931 --> 00:03:59,454
Esta charla se llama "Dinero S�lido, Modo Seguro".

121
00:03:59,465 --> 00:04:01,269
Primero, voy a hablar de la pandemia

122
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:03,165
y la ca�da econ�mica.

123
00:04:03,844 --> 00:04:07,509
En segundo lugar, el manejo de la escasez del dinero fiat

124
00:04:07,519 --> 00:04:10,151
lleva a una fuerte sugerencia

125
00:04:10,162 --> 00:04:12,427
de que podr�a ser un buen momento en la historia

126
00:04:12,438 --> 00:04:13,668
para estar mirando

127
00:04:13,679 --> 00:04:15,511
fuentes independientes de escasez.

128
00:04:15,974 --> 00:04:17,796
En tercer lugar, hablar� de la fungibilidad --

129
00:04:17,807 --> 00:04:20,069
lo que eso significa, y por qu� es importante

130
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:22,390
a medida que el mundo se mueve cada vez m�s hacia

131
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:24,368
una sociedad de vigilancia masiva.

132
00:04:24,705 --> 00:04:26,779
Y luego la cuarta parte se trata de involucrarse.

133
00:04:26,790 --> 00:04:28,171
Hay una manera superficial de involucrarse

134
00:04:28,182 --> 00:04:29,500
y una manera m�s profunda de involucrarse.

135
00:04:29,511 --> 00:04:30,750
La manera superficial ser�a

136
00:04:30,761 --> 00:04:31,937
porque es una criptomoneda,

137
00:04:31,948 --> 00:04:33,389
se comporta como un activo,

138
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:34,950
as� que me pongo mi sombrero de fondo de inversi�n

139
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:36,899
y miro a Monero y a Bitcoin,

140
00:04:36,910 --> 00:04:39,717
and also gold, as parts of one's portfolio.

141
00:04:39,728 --> 00:04:41,828
Pero la manera m�s profunda y significativa

142
00:04:41,839 --> 00:04:43,990
es involucrarte personalmente con tu

143
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,002
tiempo, energ�a y experiencia.

144
00:04:46,647 --> 00:04:48,550
Quer�a dar las gracias a algunas personas

145
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:50,310
de la comunidad de Monero a las que he

146
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:52,310
consultado mientras preparaba esta charla:

147
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:54,718
Howard "hyc" Chu, el Dr. Sarang Noether

148
00:04:54,729 --> 00:04:56,486
of the Monero Research Lab, and

149
00:04:56,497 --> 00:04:58,026
el Dr. Francisco Cabanas

150
00:04:58,037 --> 00:04:59,756
del Equipo Central de Monero.

151
00:05:01,089 --> 00:05:02,789
Aqu� en esta gr�fica estoy mostrando datos del

152
00:05:02,790 --> 00:05:04,950
gobierno de los EE.UU. que se remontan a 1980,

153
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:07,308
as� que estamos viendo 40 a�os de historia aqu�.

154
00:05:07,309 --> 00:05:09,517
La l�nea azul es el desempleo "U6" --

155
00:05:09,518 --> 00:05:11,036
esta es la fracci�n de gente

156
00:05:11,037 --> 00:05:12,310
que o bien est�

157
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:13,590
buscando trabajo, o

158
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:15,189
trabajando a tiempo parcial cuando quieren

159
00:05:15,199 --> 00:05:17,749
trabajar a tiempo completo, o est�n tan desanimados

160
00:05:17,759 --> 00:05:19,830
con su estado de tratar de encontrar un trabajo

161
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:20,870
que se han rendido.

162
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:22,994
Esto contrasta con el "U3",

163
00:05:22,995 --> 00:05:25,422
que s�lo est� contando a las personas que est�n

164
00:05:25,423 --> 00:05:27,848
buscando activamente un trabajo y no lo encuentran.

165
00:05:27,849 --> 00:05:29,523
As� que U6 es una medida m�s amplia y por lo tanto

166
00:05:29,524 --> 00:05:31,758
es ampliamente considerada como m�s precisa.

167
00:05:31,759 --> 00:05:33,849
El desempleo en el a�o 2020

168
00:05:33,850 --> 00:05:35,670
se dispar� hasta el nivel m�s alto

169
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:37,577
de la historia jam�s registrada -- al menos

170
00:05:37,578 --> 00:05:39,830
de la tasa de desempleo U6 --

171
00:05:39,831 --> 00:05:41,887
se dispar� hasta cerca del 23 por ciento.

172
00:05:41,888 --> 00:05:43,392
Afortunadamente, eso ha bajado un poco

173
00:05:43,393 --> 00:05:44,710
desde entonces, pero

174
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:46,576
definitivamente no es un n�mero bonito.

175
00:05:46,577 --> 00:05:49,331
As� que la demanda por servicios como

176
00:05:49,332 --> 00:05:51,029
viajes, entretenimiento -- todo

177
00:05:51,039 --> 00:05:53,189
todo cay� por el suelo -- y la

178
00:05:53,199 --> 00:05:54,710
reacci�n del gobierno federal a eso

179
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:57,270
fue preocuparse por la deflaci�n.

180
00:05:57,280 --> 00:06:00,128
To fight that, they expanded the money supply,

181
00:06:00,129 --> 00:06:01,355
porque al imprimir dinero,

182
00:06:01,356 --> 00:06:03,400
eso reduce la tasa de inter�s, entonces se vuelve

183
00:06:03,401 --> 00:06:05,005
menos atractivo ahorrar tu dinero

184
00:06:05,006 --> 00:06:06,756
y obtener un poco de inter�s, y se vuelve

185
00:06:06,757 --> 00:06:08,784
m�s atractivo gastar tu dinero.

186
00:06:09,267 --> 00:06:10,194
Aqu� en verde est� la

187
00:06:10,195 --> 00:06:13,110
MZM money supply -- MZM stands for

188
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:14,727
"dinero cero madurez"

189
00:06:14,728 --> 00:06:16,807
y en lo que consiste es en la

190
00:06:16,808 --> 00:06:19,590
oferta M1 -- que es monedas, billetes,

191
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:21,990
y cuentas corrientes -- y combina

192
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,909
eso con cuentas de ahorro y

193
00:06:23,919 --> 00:06:25,510
cuentas del mercado monetario, lo cual mucha gente

194
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:26,848
use as an alternate form of a

195
00:06:26,849 --> 00:06:28,309
una cuenta de ahorros en estos d�as.

196
00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:30,444
He normalizado esa cifra al producto

197
00:06:30,445 --> 00:06:32,150
interno bruto -- que es el valor de

198
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:33,670
todos los bienes y servicios producidos en los

199
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:35,270
EE.UU. en un a�o.

200
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:38,390
La oferta monetaria como una fracci�n de la

201
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:39,990
producci�n de los EE.UU.

202
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,859
ha ido en aumento durante los �ltimos cuarenta a�os,

203
00:06:41,860 --> 00:06:43,672
and you can see here at 2020

204
00:06:43,673 --> 00:06:45,189
la l�nea se eleva de

205
00:06:45,199 --> 00:06:48,150
alrededor del 70 por ciento a m�s del 100 por ciento.

206
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:50,324
La palabra "sin precedentes" se usa mucho

207
00:06:50,325 --> 00:06:52,356
para esta crisis, pero en verdad, si miras

208
00:06:52,357 --> 00:06:53,895
las gr�ficas a largo plazo como esta y ves

209
00:06:53,896 --> 00:06:55,510
el tama�o y la pendiente

210
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:57,270
de esta impresi�n de dinero que ha estado

211
00:06:57,280 --> 00:06:58,629
ocurriendo en los �ltimos meses --

212
00:06:58,639 --> 00:07:00,482
it's truly breathtaking.

213
00:07:00,677 --> 00:07:02,192
Por supuesto que el gobierno puede

214
00:07:02,193 --> 00:07:04,706
imprimir tanto o tan poco dinero como quiera,

215
00:07:04,707 --> 00:07:06,070
sin que nada les impida

216
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:07,510
hacer lo que quieran --

217
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:10,182
esto ha sido as� desde que [el presidente] Nixon aboli�

218
00:07:10,183 --> 00:07:12,844
la vinculaci�n del d�lar estadounidense con el oro.

219
00:07:13,088 --> 00:07:14,550
Mirando la l�nea de abajo aqu�,

220
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:16,230
esto es cu�nto dinero est� recibiendo

221
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:17,350
el gobierno de EE.UU.

222
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:18,950
menos cu�nto dinero est� gastando

223
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:20,870
government spending, on a monthly basis.

224
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:23,350
As� que, b�sicamente son los impuestos menos el gasto.

225
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:25,110
Tiene picos cuatro veces al a�o porque

226
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:26,790
es cuando se deben pagar los impuestos estimados

227
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:29,222
y por eso tiene esa estructura por estaciones.

228
00:07:29,496 --> 00:07:31,266
Como puedes ver realmente se derrumb�,

229
00:07:31,267 --> 00:07:33,918
especialmente en el segundo trimestre de 2020.

230
00:07:33,919 --> 00:07:35,990
El 15 de abril, que es la fecha l�mite normal

231
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,830
para el pago de impuestos, se retras� al

232
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:39,749
15 de julio, debido a la pandemia.

233
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:41,749
As� que no hab�a ingresos fiscales entrantes,

234
00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:43,689
pero el gobierno continuaba gastando

235
00:07:43,690 --> 00:07:45,150
dinero como antes.

236
00:07:45,151 --> 00:07:46,309
Los gastos no se detuvieron,

237
00:07:46,338 --> 00:07:48,161
s�lo los ingresos se detuvieron.

238
00:07:48,395 --> 00:07:50,390
Y as� esto podr�a revertirse,

239
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:52,564
ahora que el 15 de julio ha llegado y se ha ido,

240
00:07:52,565 --> 00:07:55,612
with a correspondingly high spike in taxes --

241
00:07:55,613 --> 00:07:58,709
es decir, asumiendo que este 15 de julio fue una bonanza

242
00:07:58,710 --> 00:08:00,090
desde el punto de vista del IRS

243
00:08:00,091 --> 00:08:01,282
con un mont�n de dinero de los impuestos entrando --

244
00:08:01,283 --> 00:08:03,129
veremos si ese fue realmente el caso.

245
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:05,400
Si integras esto con el tiempo,

246
00:08:05,401 --> 00:08:07,139
entonces obtienes la l�nea negra

247
00:08:07,140 --> 00:08:08,710
que est� en la parte superior, que es el

248
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:11,699
total de la deuda federal normalizada al PIB, de nuevo.

249
00:08:11,976 --> 00:08:13,930
En el per�odo posterior a la

250
00:08:13,931 --> 00:08:16,824
crisis financiera de 2008-2009,

251
00:08:16,825 --> 00:08:18,373
el gobierno estaba gastando

252
00:08:18,374 --> 00:08:19,507
bastante m�s dinero

253
00:08:19,508 --> 00:08:20,675
del que estaba recaudando,

254
00:08:20,676 --> 00:08:22,897
y como resultado, cuando integras esto con el tiempo,

255
00:08:22,898 --> 00:08:24,177
obtienes la l�nea negra que est� aqu� arriba

256
00:08:24,178 --> 00:08:26,473
en la deuda federal entre el PIB.

257
00:08:26,781 --> 00:08:28,769
Y ahora estamos en este punto aqu�

258
00:08:28,770 --> 00:08:30,151
a principios de a�o --

259
00:08:30,152 --> 00:08:32,958
la relaci�n entre la deuda y el PIB es de aproximadamente 110 por ciento

260
00:08:32,959 --> 00:08:35,689
y eso es antes de la pandemia.

261
00:08:36,719 --> 00:08:38,790
En el G20, hay ocho pa�ses

262
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:40,230
que han estado reportando

263
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:42,389
estad�sticas sobre la cantidad de dinero que est�

264
00:08:42,399 --> 00:08:45,014
en circulaci�n en su moneda particular.

265
00:08:45,117 --> 00:08:47,269
Aqu�, he normalizado la cantidad de dinero

266
00:08:47,279 --> 00:08:48,470
en cada pa�s para que sea

267
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:51,670
igual a 1 en enero de 2020.

268
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:53,670
Hay esta forma de palo de hockey en esta

269
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:56,710
curva de cu�nto dinero est� circulando.

270
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:59,479
En los Estados Unidos, la expansi�n de la M1 ha sido

271
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:02,239
del orden de 1,33 billones de d�lares --

272
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:03,642
lo que equivale a un

273
00:09:03,643 --> 00:09:04,962
aumento de la oferta monetaria de unos

274
00:09:04,963 --> 00:09:07,269
300 millones de d�lares por hora.

275
00:09:07,279 --> 00:09:09,110
Ahora, si se compara esto con, por ejemplo,

276
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:10,870
la capitalizaci�n del mercado de Monero -- que es

277
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:13,276
algo del orden de un millardo y medio --

278
00:09:13,277 --> 00:09:15,269
as� que la oferta monetaria de los EE.UU.

279
00:09:15,279 --> 00:09:19,039
se expandi� por el tama�o de la capitalizaci�n del mercado de Monero,

280
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:20,852
aproximadamente cinco veces cada d�a

281
00:09:20,853 --> 00:09:23,181
durante los �ltimos seis meses.

282
00:09:23,839 --> 00:09:26,310
Ampliemos nuestro enfoque no s�lo a los

283
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:28,639
ocho pa�ses del G20 que han reportado

284
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:30,389
resultados recientemente, sino que veamos

285
00:09:30,399 --> 00:09:32,070
todas las monedas fiat del G20

286
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:34,550
y ampliemos tambi�n el marco temporal

287
00:09:34,561 --> 00:09:36,709
en el que miramos hacia 2009,

288
00:09:36,710 --> 00:09:39,039
el a�o en el que sali� Bitcoin.

289
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:41,350
El dinero de cada pa�s es igual a 1

290
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:42,949
a principios de 2009.

291
00:09:42,959 --> 00:09:44,790
Puedes ver que no hay ninguna de las

292
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:47,110
monedas del G20 que se haya mantenido estable

293
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:48,832
o que realmente haya disminuido su

294
00:09:48,833 --> 00:09:49,870
oferta monetaria con el tiempo --

295
00:09:49,871 --> 00:09:51,849
todo ha aumentado.

296
00:09:52,205 --> 00:09:53,990
Como ex profesor de la escuela de medicina

297
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,690
que trabaj� en oncolog�a,

298
00:09:55,691 --> 00:09:57,350
la matem�tica exponencial del

299
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:59,509
crecimiento descontrolado en tumores cancerosos

300
00:09:59,519 --> 00:10:00,732
es algo en lo que pienso

301
00:10:00,733 --> 00:10:02,550
cuando veo una gr�fica como esta.

302
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:04,134
Antes de la pandemia, estamos viendo un

303
00:10:04,135 --> 00:10:05,910
tiempo de duplicaci�n de unos 8 a�os.

304
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:07,670
Si piensas en cu�nto tiempo

305
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:10,870
sobrevive un humano promedio, digamos 80 a�os--

306
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:12,780
es decir, 10 veces el doble,

307
00:10:12,781 --> 00:10:14,230
lo que significa que la cantidad de

308
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:16,230
money expansion in an average human's

309
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:17,990
humano promedio es de 2 a la 10� potencia,

310
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,389
which is 1,024 -- it's about a thousand

311
00:10:20,399 --> 00:10:22,406
veces el aumento de la oferta monetaria.

312
00:10:22,567 --> 00:10:25,119
And that is before the pandemic --

313
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:26,550
despu�s de la pandemia, estamos viendo un

314
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:29,269
tiempo de duplicaci�n que se acerca m�s a los dos a�os.

315
00:10:29,279 --> 00:10:31,110
There's an interesting scholarly book

316
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:32,949
llamado "Reg�menes Monetarios e Inflaci�n"

317
00:10:32,959 --> 00:10:36,150
que hizo un estudio de 29 casos hist�ricos

318
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:37,910
de hiperinflaci�n.

319
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:39,829
Al menos para los estadounidenses, ninguno de nosotros ha

320
00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:41,829
tenido que vivir eso, pero todos

321
00:10:41,839 --> 00:10:43,430
los informes de lo que es

322
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:44,630
sobrevivir a trav�s de algo as� es que

323
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:46,710
no es nada divertido -- acaba con los ahorros

324
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:47,990
de la gente, promueve

325
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,870
el malestar social -- simplemente no es bonito.

326
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:53,190
Este libro lleg� a la conclusi�n de que

327
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:54,762
en 25 de 29 de estos

328
00:10:54,763 --> 00:10:56,747
casos hist�ricos de hiperinflaci�n,

329
00:10:56,748 --> 00:10:58,126
el desencadenante fue que hubo

330
00:10:58,127 --> 00:10:59,266
creaci�n de dinero

331
00:10:59,267 --> 00:11:01,855
que financi� los d�ficits del gobierno.

332
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,509
Estos gr�ficos deber�an ser una evidencia

333
00:11:03,519 --> 00:11:05,110
convincente de que la creaci�n de dinero --

334
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:06,673
que es la mitad de esta ecuaci�n --

335
00:11:06,674 --> 00:11:08,470
est� efectivamente ocurriendo.

336
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:10,613
La segunda mitad es el d�ficit del gobierno --

337
00:11:10,614 --> 00:11:12,799
as� que a menos que los gobiernos sean capaces de tomar

338
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:14,870
decisiones extremadamente dif�ciles y puedan

339
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:16,230
equilibrar sus presupuestos,

340
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:18,150
ahora vamos a tener dos de dos

341
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:20,310
de estos criterios cumplidos.

342
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:22,949
La conclusi�n de la gente de que el dinero

343
00:11:22,959 --> 00:11:23,990
ya no es

344
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,550
confiable y debe ser gastado inmediatamente,

345
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:28,550
de lo contrario pierde valor --

346
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:30,630
esa decisi�n, que debe tener lugar

347
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:32,150
entre toda una poblaci�n

348
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:34,348
para que se produzca la hiperinflaci�n --

349
00:11:34,349 --> 00:11:35,838
es una cosa social.

350
00:11:35,839 --> 00:11:37,829
It's the herd that decides that they

351
00:11:37,839 --> 00:11:39,627
don't have confidence in the money any more,

352
00:11:39,631 --> 00:11:40,924
it's hard to predict.  So,

353
00:11:40,925 --> 00:11:42,630
it's not a foregone conclusion

354
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:44,069
that money creation plus government

355
00:11:44,079 --> 00:11:46,150
deficits means hyperinflation or

356
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:47,269
increased inflation --

357
00:11:47,279 --> 00:11:49,696
but it certainly doesn't help.

358
00:11:49,697 --> 00:11:51,829
The takeaway for anyone with

359
00:11:51,839 --> 00:11:54,870
assets to save is that it might be wise

360
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:57,430
to consider the possibility that the

361
00:11:57,440 --> 00:11:58,629
future might hold

362
00:11:58,639 --> 00:12:00,894
higher inflation than what you are used to,

363
00:12:00,895 --> 00:12:02,230
and indeed what you might be

364
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:04,790
comfortable with.

365
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:06,629
In a hyperinflation scenario, there have

366
00:12:06,639 --> 00:12:08,389
been independent sources of scarcity

367
00:12:08,399 --> 00:12:09,878
that have been looked at to

368
00:12:09,879 --> 00:12:11,773
store wealth.  Physical commodities,

369
00:12:11,774 --> 00:12:12,949
for example, gold and silver --

370
00:12:12,959 --> 00:12:14,710
these are the classic ones.

371
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:16,473
And since 2009,

372
00:12:16,474 --> 00:12:18,470
there's a new option for humanity,

373
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:20,389
that is in the form of digital commodities,

374
00:12:20,390 --> 00:12:22,879
which became possible to consider

375
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:24,492
after the development of the

376
00:12:24,493 --> 00:12:27,134
Satoshi Nakamoto Bitcoin white paper.

377
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:31,030
Let's contrast digital fiat versus

378
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:32,776
decentralized digital scarcity

379
00:12:32,777 --> 00:12:34,790
like Bitcoin and Monero.

380
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:37,278
Fiat money is a source of digital scarcity,

381
00:12:37,279 --> 00:12:38,870
it's just that that scarcity is

382
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:41,430
controlled by a centralized entity.

383
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:44,230
Access to the database of who owns what

384
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:46,629
is protected -- there's a moat of firewalls

385
00:12:46,639 --> 00:12:47,670
around that.

386
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:49,415
Once you have access, you have

387
00:12:49,416 --> 00:12:51,509
quite a bit of ability to change things.

388
00:12:51,519 --> 00:12:53,558
At the lower level, like at a bank teller level,

389
00:12:53,559 --> 00:12:54,497
of course you can't just

390
00:12:54,498 --> 00:12:55,910
create money out of thin air.

391
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:58,389
As you go up in the system, the amount of

392
00:12:58,399 --> 00:13:00,389
power that you have over that database

393
00:13:00,399 --> 00:13:02,150
becomes higher, so that now you get to

394
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:03,910
the level of the Federal Reserve Bank --

395
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:06,069
it becomes arbitrary write access to

396
00:13:06,079 --> 00:13:07,590
this ledger.

397
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:09,110
And of course the software that controls

398
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:10,710
this is closed source -- why would they

399
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:12,710
open source it -- that would facilitate bad

400
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:15,110
actors learning how the system works.

401
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:16,389
There are downsides to this;

402
00:13:16,399 --> 00:13:18,310
mismanagement is probably the chief one --

403
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:19,750
all these plots that I was showing of

404
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:22,069
the money supply could be interpreted as

405
00:13:22,079 --> 00:13:23,590
signs of mismanagement.

406
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:25,590
The Federal Reserve is supposed to be

407
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:26,870
imposing discipline,

408
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:29,030
independent of the political process --

409
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:30,790
the Federal Reserve is supposed to be the

410
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:32,069
entity that says

411
00:13:32,079 --> 00:13:34,150
"no, I'm sorry, please don't look to us to

412
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:36,150
be manufacturing money out of thin air,

413
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:37,829
because that's not sustainable."

414
00:13:37,839 --> 00:13:39,030
That's what the Federal Reserve is

415
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:40,012
supposed to do.

416
00:13:40,013 --> 00:13:41,795
It's not really doing that.

417
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:44,470
There's also insider abuse that is a

418
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:45,990
problem with these sorts of centralized

419
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,110
security models.

420
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:49,350
There are plenty of examples of large

421
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:50,389
banks that do

422
00:13:50,399 --> 00:13:52,550
egregious things to abuse the trust of

423
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:54,150
their customers and get away with it

424
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:55,829
with just a slap on the wrist.

425
00:13:55,839 --> 00:13:58,230
Basically, you have middlemen between

426
00:13:58,240 --> 00:13:59,910
the people and the database --

427
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:01,444
these middlemen who are in a position

428
00:14:01,445 --> 00:14:02,608
of power -- and so there's

429
00:14:02,609 --> 00:14:04,556
little incentive to improve.

430
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:06,389
So, the decentralized security model of

431
00:14:06,399 --> 00:14:07,573
Bitcoin, and also Monero,

432
00:14:07,574 --> 00:14:09,030
is totally different.

433
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:10,875
In these decentralized networks,

434
00:14:10,881 --> 00:14:12,618
anyone can join the peer-to-peer network.

435
00:14:12,619 --> 00:14:15,030
Anyone can download the Monero code,

436
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:17,269
run it on their computer, and become part

437
00:14:17,279 --> 00:14:18,870
of this network which

438
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:22,069
does the functions of what a bank does.

439
00:14:22,079 --> 00:14:24,150
So in contrast to the centralized

440
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:26,150
security model where you have a master

441
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:27,348
database sitting in the middle

442
00:14:27,349 --> 00:14:29,430
with all sorts of firewalls and protections

443
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:32,309
around it to try and defend it from misuse,

444
00:14:32,310 --> 00:14:35,110
here each node has its own copy of the

445
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:36,735
database that contains a record of

446
00:14:36,736 --> 00:14:38,870
who sent what to who.

447
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:40,949
In the decentralized security model it's

448
00:14:40,959 --> 00:14:42,870
open source -- it would have to be --

449
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:44,629
if anyone is able to join the

450
00:14:44,639 --> 00:14:46,070
peer-to-peer network, you'd better

451
00:14:46,071 --> 00:14:47,360
make your code open source,

452
00:14:47,361 --> 00:14:48,371
because otherwise,

453
00:14:48,372 --> 00:14:49,933
how do you know what you're running?

454
00:14:50,148 --> 00:14:51,670
"The Cathedral and the Bazaar," the

455
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:53,509
classic open source software development

456
00:14:53,519 --> 00:14:55,269
book that contrasts the building of a

457
00:14:55,279 --> 00:14:57,030
cathedral -- which is a centralized

458
00:14:57,040 --> 00:14:58,657
process a la Microsoft --

459
00:14:58,658 --> 00:15:00,470
versus the bazaar -- which is

460
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:02,389
a farmers' market where everyone is free

461
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:03,976
to show up and just build something --

462
00:15:03,977 --> 00:15:06,041
which would be the Linux model.

463
00:15:06,042 --> 00:15:07,478
These two situations --

464
00:15:07,479 --> 00:15:09,306
fiat versus decentralized money --

465
00:15:09,307 --> 00:15:11,728
it's really like Microsoft versus Linux.

466
00:15:11,991 --> 00:15:13,829
Of course there are downsides to use of

467
00:15:13,839 --> 00:15:16,066
FOSS in money; it's new,

468
00:15:16,067 --> 00:15:17,829
fewer people have heard of it.

469
00:15:17,839 --> 00:15:20,069
It's relatively inefficient, because if

470
00:15:20,079 --> 00:15:22,069
there's no "boss" computer within this

471
00:15:22,079 --> 00:15:23,110
peer-to-peer network,

472
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:24,710
then how are you going to decide what

473
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:26,790
the true version is of the database that

474
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:29,149
keeps track of who owns what?

475
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:32,285
Currently, cryptocurrencies are

476
00:15:32,286 --> 00:15:34,808
able to be traded for fiat currencies,

477
00:15:34,809 --> 00:15:36,958
but this used to not be the case.

478
00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:40,479
Back in 2009, Bitcoin had zero dollar value.

479
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:43,430
It was this interesting curiosity of a

480
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:45,350
system that purported to

481
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:47,250
make a new form of scarcity

482
00:15:47,251 --> 00:15:48,629
that acted like money.

483
00:15:48,639 --> 00:15:50,710
But back in 2009, nobody knew that

484
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:52,230
that was actually the case;

485
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:54,150
nobody knew if this thing would actually

486
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:55,990
work like it said it would work.

487
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,773
And so, I think it's a good idea,

488
00:15:57,774 --> 00:15:59,430
if you're new to cryptocurrency --

489
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:01,350
before you get caught up in the latest

490
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:03,030
price movement of this and that currency

491
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:04,389
and the horse race --

492
00:16:04,399 --> 00:16:06,550
I would suggest pretending that all of

493
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:08,389
cryptocurrency has zero value.

494
00:16:08,399 --> 00:16:10,259
It'll end up being good for you in the long run

495
00:16:10,260 --> 00:16:11,518
because you'll have a more solid

496
00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:13,147
understanding of what's actually going on

497
00:16:13,148 --> 00:16:15,599
with this stuff that you're buying and selling.

498
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:16,992
Now there are three aspects that

499
00:16:16,993 --> 00:16:18,471
you need to get working

500
00:16:18,472 --> 00:16:20,502
to create a private form of money.

501
00:16:20,503 --> 00:16:22,683
First, you have to have some sense of

502
00:16:22,684 --> 00:16:25,359
what is the analogy of a bank account.

503
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:27,269
Second, is you need to have some analogy

504
00:16:27,279 --> 00:16:28,949
to what it is to write a check --

505
00:16:28,959 --> 00:16:31,030
and third, you need to have some sort of

506
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:32,270
process for that check,

507
00:16:32,271 --> 00:16:33,846
once it's shown to be legitimate,

508
00:16:33,847 --> 00:16:35,700
to be processed through the system.

509
00:16:36,079 --> 00:16:38,629
So, I'd like to turn the clock back and

510
00:16:38,639 --> 00:16:40,898
summarize how Bitcoin works.

511
00:16:41,199 --> 00:16:43,509
Bitcoin is based on the secp256k1 elliptic

512
00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:45,430
curve, and that's written out here --

513
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:47,350
it's public knowledge what this elliptic

514
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:48,710
curve is, there's nothing secret about it,

515
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:50,069
it's a public standard:

516
00:16:50,079 --> 00:16:52,337
y squared is congruent to x cubed plus 7,

517
00:16:52,338 --> 00:16:54,790
mod this very large prime number.

518
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:57,269
x and y, usually, you think of as being

519
00:16:57,279 --> 00:16:58,514
real numbers -- think of

520
00:16:58,515 --> 00:16:59,749
high school algebra, and you

521
00:16:59,759 --> 00:17:01,430
want to plot this curve, you'll make a

522
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:02,949
curvy shape out of this --

523
00:17:02,959 --> 00:17:04,645
but in this case, we're restricting

524
00:17:04,646 --> 00:17:06,150
x and y to be integers.

525
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:08,309
And furthermore, these integers are

526
00:17:08,319 --> 00:17:09,577
modulus this prime number,

527
00:17:09,578 --> 00:17:11,601
which is basically clock arithmetic --

528
00:17:11,602 --> 00:17:12,817
this is saying that 1 o'clock,

529
00:17:12,818 --> 00:17:14,335
13 o'clock, 25 o'clock

530
00:17:14,336 --> 00:17:16,599
are all the same, because every 12,

531
00:17:16,600 --> 00:17:18,390
your counting goes back.

532
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:19,961
So that's the case here, except

533
00:17:19,962 --> 00:17:21,632
instead of a clock with 12 numbers,

534
00:17:21,633 --> 00:17:22,789
you have a clock with a

535
00:17:22,799 --> 00:17:24,567
70-some digit prime number of

536
00:17:24,568 --> 00:17:26,470
numbers on its dial.

537
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:28,870
You have this universe-sized sheet of

538
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:31,051
grid paper with (x,y) coordinates

539
00:17:31,052 --> 00:17:32,798
that are each integers --

540
00:17:32,799 --> 00:17:35,510
and some of the points on this gigantic

541
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:37,590
sheet of grid paper are solutions to

542
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:39,830
this particular elliptic curve.

543
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:42,390
If one was to try to guess random

544
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:43,909
combinations of x and y

545
00:17:43,919 --> 00:17:45,600
to come up with a solution to this,

546
00:17:45,601 --> 00:17:47,190
it's basically impossible.

547
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:48,710
So fortunately, part of the elliptic curve

548
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:50,789
definition is to provide you with

549
00:17:50,799 --> 00:17:52,470
a solution called the base point.

550
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:54,590
The base point is a solution --

551
00:17:54,591 --> 00:17:56,230
x sub b, y sub b -- which

552
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:58,710
is known to solve this equation.

553
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:00,310
And furthermore, because of the mathematics

554
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:01,350
of elliptic curves,

555
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:03,321
if somebody gives you an integer n,

556
00:18:03,322 --> 00:18:04,710
it's possible to compute

557
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:07,750
another solution, P sub n, which would be

558
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:09,139
n times the base point.

559
00:18:09,140 --> 00:18:10,403
It's not just that you take

560
00:18:10,404 --> 00:18:12,070
the base point and you multiply

561
00:18:12,087 --> 00:18:13,646
both the x and y coordinates by the number n,

562
00:18:13,647 --> 00:18:15,270
it's more sophisticated than that.

563
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:18,150
But the idea is, if somebody tells you n,

564
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:20,354
you can compute the n-th point

565
00:18:20,355 --> 00:18:22,479
that is a solution to the elliptic curve.

566
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:23,724
It's a one-way function --

567
00:18:23,725 --> 00:18:25,152
so if someone tells you n,

568
00:18:25,153 --> 00:18:26,296
you can get P sub n,

569
00:18:26,297 --> 00:18:27,647
but if someone tells you P sub n,

570
00:18:27,648 --> 00:18:29,830
you can't get n, you have to brute force that.

571
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:32,412
To brute force this, is a 10 to the 70th

572
00:18:32,413 --> 00:18:33,706
chance of getting it right,

573
00:18:33,707 --> 00:18:36,070
which means, might as well just not try.

574
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:37,778
The location of that point,

575
00:18:37,779 --> 00:18:39,909
translated to a string of

576
00:18:39,919 --> 00:18:42,760
letters and numbers, is the Bitcoin address.

577
00:18:42,761 --> 00:18:44,443
At the heart of it, a Bitcoin address

578
00:18:44,444 --> 00:18:46,376
is representing an (x,y) coordinate

579
00:18:46,377 --> 00:18:49,350
on the secp256k1 elliptic curve.

580
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:51,612
The number n is the private key,

581
00:18:51,613 --> 00:18:52,630
that's the secret --

582
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:55,190
and knowing that number n is the

583
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:57,110
authorized signature to spend

584
00:18:57,120 --> 00:18:58,899
the money that is associated with

585
00:18:58,900 --> 00:19:01,005
the public key, P sub n.

586
00:19:01,006 --> 00:19:02,079
They're linked to each other,

587
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:03,862
so that's why it's not like a password

588
00:19:03,863 --> 00:19:05,068
where you can just change

589
00:19:05,069 --> 00:19:06,558
the numbers that you're assigned --

590
00:19:06,559 --> 00:19:07,909
it doesn't work like that, there's a math

591
00:19:07,919 --> 00:19:09,029
equation behind it --

592
00:19:09,039 --> 00:19:10,950
so if somebody forgets their secret,

593
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:12,470
there's no recourse.

594
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:14,230
Getting a new Bitcoin account really

595
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:15,669
means you're picking a number --

596
00:19:15,679 --> 00:19:16,849
you're picking a number

597
00:19:16,850 --> 00:19:19,270
in this vast numeric field.

598
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:21,169
You're calling that number yours.

599
00:19:21,170 --> 00:19:23,669
Just like Coca-Cola keeps the formula to

600
00:19:23,679 --> 00:19:25,773
its soft drink secret,

601
00:19:25,873 --> 00:19:27,372
it's this piece of information

602
00:19:27,373 --> 00:19:29,680
that you can write on an index card.

603
00:19:29,681 --> 00:19:31,032
You, and you alone,

604
00:19:31,033 --> 00:19:32,710
are the person who knows

605
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:35,590
the existence of this one certain point

606
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:37,888
on the elliptic curve which is yours.

607
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:40,077
So if you are in possession of a

608
00:19:40,078 --> 00:19:41,909
public-private key pair

609
00:19:41,919 --> 00:19:43,669
and you have a message that you want to

610
00:19:43,679 --> 00:19:45,750
send to the world, and you want to make

611
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:47,537
sure that everyone in the world knows that

612
00:19:47,538 --> 00:19:49,999
that message came from you, and only you --

613
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,166
you would take your message,

614
00:19:51,167 --> 00:19:52,624
combine it with your private key,

615
00:19:52,625 --> 00:19:53,647
to produce a signature --

616
00:19:53,648 --> 00:19:55,830
which is a block of bytes that is unique

617
00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:57,310
to the combination of the message

618
00:19:57,311 --> 00:19:58,668
and the private key.

619
00:19:58,669 --> 00:20:00,150
Then you would send your message

620
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:01,272
and you would include with your

621
00:20:01,273 --> 00:20:02,808
plaintext message the signature,

622
00:20:02,809 --> 00:20:05,722
which is this byte block that you generated.

623
00:20:06,027 --> 00:20:07,427
As a recipient now,

624
00:20:07,428 --> 00:20:08,630
you get this message

625
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:10,230
and you got the signature from the

626
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:11,318
purported sender,

627
00:20:11,319 --> 00:20:13,159
and you combine this with the public key

628
00:20:13,160 --> 00:20:15,430
which you know to be from the sender.

629
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:16,781
When you combine all three of those,

630
00:20:16,782 --> 00:20:18,808
you get a binary verification result that says,

631
00:20:18,809 --> 00:20:20,271
"yes" this was a legitimate message

632
00:20:20,272 --> 00:20:22,630
from the sender, or "no" it was not.

633
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:24,630
This kind of message signing happens in

634
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:26,470
a variety of computing contexts --

635
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:29,029
for example, HTTPS uses this --

636
00:20:29,039 --> 00:20:30,470
here we're just using it in a

637
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:33,604
self-contained financial accounting system.

638
00:20:33,605 --> 00:20:35,029
"Sending Bitcoin" means

639
00:20:35,039 --> 00:20:37,270
that you're sending this signed message,

640
00:20:37,271 --> 00:20:38,710
analogous to a check.

641
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:39,666
So interestingly,

642
00:20:39,667 --> 00:20:41,238
knowledge of the private key,

643
00:20:41,239 --> 00:20:43,430
which is a form of speech,

644
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:45,628
is now tantamount to money.

645
00:20:45,629 --> 00:20:47,100
It's kind of an attractive thing

646
00:20:47,101 --> 00:20:48,643
for the era that we're living in,

647
00:20:48,644 --> 00:20:51,270
the idea that knowledge of something can,

648
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:53,581
in itself, be cash.

649
00:20:54,064 --> 00:20:56,230
Once you have a person who has a

650
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:57,590
Bitcoin account and they

651
00:20:57,600 --> 00:20:58,805
sign a message saying

652
00:20:58,806 --> 00:21:00,419
"I want to spend this bitcoin,"

653
00:21:00,420 --> 00:21:01,655
who's going to do the processing,

654
00:21:01,656 --> 00:21:03,430
who's going to make sure it's legit?

655
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:05,823
That is done by a network of miners in Bitcoin.

656
00:21:05,824 --> 00:21:08,179
So "miners" are just a word for

657
00:21:08,180 --> 00:21:09,937
peer-to-peer Bitcoin accountants --

658
00:21:09,938 --> 00:21:11,699
there is no "boss" computer,

659
00:21:11,700 --> 00:21:13,356
they are all equal.

660
00:21:13,357 --> 00:21:15,688
So how do they settle disputes?

661
00:21:15,689 --> 00:21:17,614
Basically, they gossip a lot,

662
00:21:17,615 --> 00:21:20,055
and they do majority rules.

663
00:21:20,056 --> 00:21:21,787
And so each of these accountants,

664
00:21:21,788 --> 00:21:24,245
when they receive a spend message,

665
00:21:24,246 --> 00:21:26,142
they will check it, and if it's legit,

666
00:21:26,143 --> 00:21:27,685
then they will pass that message on

667
00:21:27,686 --> 00:21:29,779
to their compatriots.

668
00:21:29,780 --> 00:21:31,350
A block is simply a list

669
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:33,843
of valid signed spend messages.

670
00:21:33,844 --> 00:21:34,950
In each block

671
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:37,560
there is a small data field called the nonce

672
00:21:37,561 --> 00:21:39,590
that each miner is free to fill

673
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:42,310
with whatever random bits they want.

674
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:44,089
A block is not accepted

675
00:21:44,090 --> 00:21:45,990
by the network until

676
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,310
the hash of the block is lower than a

677
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:50,789
certain number, called the difficulty.

678
00:21:50,799 --> 00:21:52,029
The difficulty number is

679
00:21:52,030 --> 00:21:54,390
dynamically adjusted so that the

680
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:56,549
number of valid blocks that happened in a

681
00:21:56,559 --> 00:21:59,270
10-minute interval is 1, on average.

682
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:00,470
This is something that's hard to get

683
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:01,510
your head around if this is the first

684
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:02,710
time you're hearing it, because usually

685
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:04,390
when you think about hash functions, you

686
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:05,990
don't care about the value of what the

687
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,590
hash is -- you just care that the hash

688
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:09,029
matches something else.

689
00:22:09,039 --> 00:22:10,230
For example, if you're checking the

690
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:11,990
download of a file, you want to take a

691
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,590
hash of what it is you downloaded and

692
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:15,029
check that against the hash of what you

693
00:22:15,039 --> 00:22:16,390
think you downloaded and make sure that

694
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:17,590
they match.

695
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:19,590
Here in this case, we actually care if

696
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:21,270
the hash starts with a zero

697
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:23,669
or a one -- in fact, we care about the first

698
00:22:23,679 --> 00:22:25,430
several digits of the hash, and we will

699
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:27,830
require them to all be zeros.

700
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:29,207
So each of these miners

701
00:22:29,208 --> 00:22:31,270
is going to try repeatedly --

702
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:33,163
and most often fail --

703
00:22:33,164 --> 00:22:34,639
to find a nonce

704
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:37,659
that causes a block of spend messages

705
00:22:37,660 --> 00:22:39,669
to be considered valid.

706
00:22:39,679 --> 00:22:41,703
You have this worldwide network of computers.

707
00:22:41,704 --> 00:22:43,430
Each of them is churning away,

708
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:44,968
brute force guessing different

709
00:22:44,969 --> 00:22:46,470
values of the nonce.

710
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:48,230
One of them will eventually succeed and

711
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:51,359
come up with a block that satisfies the difficulty.

712
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:53,397
The computer in the network that does that

713
00:22:53,398 --> 00:22:54,710
gets what's called the block reward,

714
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:57,618
that is a bitcoin payout to the nonce solver.

715
00:22:57,619 --> 00:22:59,350
Once all of the computers in the world

716
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:01,270
get news of this new block --

717
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:02,851
again, because the accountants here

718
00:23:02,852 --> 00:23:03,923
are very gossipy --

719
00:23:03,924 --> 00:23:06,789
then they clear out the pending transactions

720
00:23:06,799 --> 00:23:08,390
in their own queues with the

721
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:10,070
transactions that have been ratified in

722
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:11,430
this new block, and then they continue

723
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:13,350
working on the next block.

724
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:14,950
And it's important to know that all of

725
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:16,789
the money came into existence as a

726
00:23:16,799 --> 00:23:18,870
payout to a computer in the network that

727
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:20,710
was helping to secure the accounting and

728
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:22,870
the bookkeeping for that network.

729
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:25,430
None of the block reward in Bitcoin was

730
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:27,260
shunted off and a cut went to a

731
00:23:27,261 --> 00:23:28,390
group of people, or

732
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:32,230
to a foundation, or used to do marketing.

733
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:34,149
And this is relevant from a regulatory

734
00:23:34,159 --> 00:23:35,669
point of view because FinCEN,

735
00:23:35,679 --> 00:23:37,270
which is one of the financial regulators

736
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:39,190
in the U.S., defines a decentralized

737
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:40,950
cryptocurrency as a currency in which

738
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:42,345
the block rewards all go

739
00:23:42,346 --> 00:23:43,993
directly to the decentralized network

740
00:23:43,994 --> 00:23:45,430
that's doing the accounting.

741
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:47,590
That's important because if you have a

742
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:49,872
chunk of money that's going to a group of people,

743
00:23:49,873 --> 00:23:50,950
then that group of people

744
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:52,470
could be considered as being the

745
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:54,070
masterminds of the operation,

746
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:55,984
so subject to increased regulation

747
00:23:55,985 --> 00:23:59,010
in terms of AML/KYC rules.

748
00:23:59,011 --> 00:24:01,127
So again, there's no one "boss" computer

749
00:24:01,128 --> 00:24:02,710
that is in charge of having the

750
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:04,390
correct version of the ledger.

751
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:05,909
If you have a conflict in the network,

752
00:24:05,919 --> 00:24:08,230
who wins?  Well, the answer is that the

753
00:24:08,231 --> 00:24:10,710
chain with more hash power is going to be

754
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:12,149
the one that is deemed to be the

755
00:24:12,159 --> 00:24:14,431
authoritative version of the blockchain.

756
00:24:14,432 --> 00:24:16,950
So this functions as a self-healing mechanism

757
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:18,149
if there's a discrepancy

758
00:24:18,159 --> 00:24:20,499
in the state of the network.

759
00:24:20,500 --> 00:24:21,941
So to summarize the Bitcoin white paper:

760
00:24:21,942 --> 00:24:25,029
Nakamoto consensus synthesizes digital scarcity.

761
00:24:25,039 --> 00:24:27,077
There's a few different kinds of scarcity.

762
00:24:27,078 --> 00:24:28,630
One is account level scarcity,

763
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:30,373
that is, the establishment of property rights

764
00:24:30,374 --> 00:24:32,284
in this system of accounting --

765
00:24:32,285 --> 00:24:33,350
so that is enforced in Bitcoin

766
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:35,990
by the users -- the individual's

767
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:37,974
selection and subsequent protection

768
00:24:37,975 --> 00:24:40,261
of an elliptic curve private key.

769
00:24:40,559 --> 00:24:41,669
How do we know that we're not going to

770
00:24:41,679 --> 00:24:43,350
have a situation like we have in fiat

771
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:44,710
banking, where we have

772
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:46,789
a money supply whose quantity is

773
00:24:46,799 --> 00:24:48,789
unpredictable over time, and is subject

774
00:24:48,799 --> 00:24:50,950
to the decisions of a central group with

775
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:53,430
arbitrary control of that money supply?

776
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:55,590
That is enforced by an open network of

777
00:24:55,600 --> 00:24:57,510
peer-to-peer accountants who are

778
00:24:57,520 --> 00:24:59,430
rewarded for behaving consistently with

779
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:01,111
the consensus ruleset.

780
00:25:01,712 --> 00:25:03,657
The majority of nodes in Bitcoin

781
00:25:03,658 --> 00:25:06,219
have coded in advance that the total number of

782
00:25:06,220 --> 00:25:07,350
bitcoins that are going to be

783
00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:09,269
rewarded to miners is going to be a

784
00:25:09,279 --> 00:25:11,743
total sum of 21 million bitcoin.

785
00:25:11,915 --> 00:25:13,909
You need majority decisions on

786
00:25:13,919 --> 00:25:16,630
this network to be considered correct,

787
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:18,310
that's how you get around the fact that

788
00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:20,310
there's no "boss" computer -- basically the

789
00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:22,870
majority rules becomes the boss --

790
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:24,630
and so a rogue computer that's

791
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:26,319
introduced to the network is going to have

792
00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:28,549
zero effect on it -- unless it can manage

793
00:25:28,559 --> 00:25:30,276
to get 51 percent of the hash power,

794
00:25:30,277 --> 00:25:33,105
which is expensive and difficult to do.

795
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:35,269
Finally you have database modification

796
00:25:35,279 --> 00:25:37,750
scarcity, which is record permanence.

797
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:39,110
Every single block in the Bitcoin

798
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:41,110
blockchain has a low hash number,

799
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:43,110
and so that makes each piece of data

800
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:44,710
that gets added to the blockchain

801
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:46,143
a rare piece of data.

802
00:25:46,144 --> 00:25:47,963
It took a lot of trial and error,

803
00:25:47,964 --> 00:25:50,018
in other words, it took a lot of proof-of-work

804
00:25:50,019 --> 00:25:52,470
to get that data added to the blockchain,

805
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:54,870
and so it's extraordinarily difficult

806
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:57,110
to make modifications to that database --

807
00:25:57,120 --> 00:25:59,110
especially as time goes on

808
00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:01,110
and more proof of work gets piled on top

809
00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:03,393
of the older transactions.

810
00:26:03,991 --> 00:26:05,750
Okay, so let's contrast that with the

811
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:07,750
scarcity features of Monero.

812
00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:11,510
Monero is not a code fork of Bitcoin --

813
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:13,126
most important when assessing,

814
00:26:13,127 --> 00:26:15,036
is Monero something worth considering

815
00:26:15,037 --> 00:26:17,689
given that Bitcoin was there first --

816
00:26:17,690 --> 00:26:19,430
most cryptocurrencies simply

817
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:21,510
did a copy-paste of Bitcoin's code and

818
00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:22,470
then made a few,

819
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:24,470
often times trivial, changes and then

820
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:27,323
publish that and call it your own cryptocurrency.

821
00:26:27,679 --> 00:26:30,798
One criterion that one can use to whittle down

822
00:26:30,799 --> 00:26:33,110
the subset of cryptocurrencies that are

823
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:34,805
worth considering, is this:

824
00:26:34,806 --> 00:26:36,374
is it simply a Bitcoin fork?

825
00:26:36,375 --> 00:26:37,687
How much original

826
00:26:37,688 --> 00:26:39,430
intellectual effort went into the

827
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:41,269
creation of this other cryptocurrency?

828
00:26:41,279 --> 00:26:43,684
In Monero it has its own separate codebase.

829
00:26:43,685 --> 00:26:44,950
In fact, it uses a completely

830
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:46,789
different elliptic curve than Bitcoin:

831
00:26:46,799 --> 00:26:48,775
Monero uses ed25519.

832
00:26:48,776 --> 00:26:50,549
That is, the (x,y) points

833
00:26:50,550 --> 00:26:52,390
on this gigantic sheet of grid paper --

834
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:54,310
which is fundamental to how the

835
00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:55,669
cryptocurrency works --

836
00:26:55,679 --> 00:26:57,590
that very equation is different in

837
00:26:57,600 --> 00:26:59,510
Monero than it is in Bitcoin.

838
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:01,669
To the extent that the elliptic curve

839
00:27:01,679 --> 00:27:02,950
used in Bitcoin

840
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:04,310
may or may not have weaknesses

841
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:05,909
associated with it -- this is a form of

842
00:27:05,919 --> 00:27:07,590
technical hedging in which Monero has

843
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:10,158
chosen, deliberately, a different elliptic curve.

844
00:27:10,159 --> 00:27:12,070
In Monero, there are two private keys:

845
00:27:12,080 --> 00:27:13,830
there's a spend key and a view key.

846
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:15,590
The spend key works like the Bitcoin

847
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:17,669
private key -- if you know the spend key,

848
00:27:17,679 --> 00:27:19,999
you are in complete control of your account.

849
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,194
There's a second key, the view key, which is

850
00:27:22,195 --> 00:27:24,719
a cryptographic subset of the spend key --

851
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:27,073
if you know the view key then you can

852
00:27:27,074 --> 00:27:29,224
look at details of transactions

853
00:27:29,225 --> 00:27:31,029
that you were involved in.

854
00:27:31,039 --> 00:27:33,190
One of the misconceptions about Monero is

855
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:34,950
it's just this completely secret box

856
00:27:34,951 --> 00:27:36,070
so you can tell nothing about

857
00:27:36,080 --> 00:27:37,497
about what's going on in it.

858
00:27:37,506 --> 00:27:39,490
You can actually share details of what's

859
00:27:39,491 --> 00:27:41,510
going on in your particular Monero account

860
00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:42,844
if you share your view key.

861
00:27:42,845 --> 00:27:45,669
It offers opt-in transparency.

862
00:27:45,679 --> 00:27:47,987
In Monero the address space is larger:

863
00:27:47,988 --> 00:27:50,487
10 to the 76th different addresses to choose

864
00:27:50,488 --> 00:27:53,350
from, versus 10 to the 60th in Bitcoin.

865
00:27:53,360 --> 00:27:55,590
This means that there is more security

866
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:57,510
in terms of the birthday problem.

867
00:27:57,520 --> 00:27:59,370
When one is choosing a cryptocurrency account,

868
00:27:59,371 --> 00:28:00,953
one is simply picking a point

869
00:28:00,954 --> 00:28:02,149
on this grid paper.

870
00:28:02,159 --> 00:28:03,909
What is the risk that somebody else in

871
00:28:03,919 --> 00:28:06,149
the world picks the point that I picked?

872
00:28:06,159 --> 00:28:07,909
If they pick the point that I pick, then

873
00:28:07,919 --> 00:28:09,590
they will know the private and public

874
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:11,430
keys for that elliptic curve point.

875
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:12,955
Therefore I'm going to be sharing my

876
00:28:12,956 --> 00:28:14,307
my money with this stranger

877
00:28:14,308 --> 00:28:15,990
somewhere else in the world.

878
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:18,310
That is a possibility -- so in that sense

879
00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:19,935
there is security by obscurity

880
00:28:19,936 --> 00:28:21,909
in cryptocurrencies -- but that is

881
00:28:21,919 --> 00:28:23,510
mitigated by the vast number of

882
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:25,110
addresses that are possible.

883
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:27,350
And there's an even more vast number of

884
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:29,190
addresses in Monero than there are in

885
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:31,428
Bitcoin -- by 10 to the 16th.

886
00:28:31,429 --> 00:28:32,792
The drawback of this is that

887
00:28:32,793 --> 00:28:34,310
you have a less user-friendly

888
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:35,750
experience, because the

889
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:37,990
address lengths in Monero are very long

890
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:40,149
strings of numbers and letters.

891
00:28:40,159 --> 00:28:41,669
The emission schedule is different in

892
00:28:41,679 --> 00:28:43,590
Monero relative to Bitcoin.

893
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:45,873
In Bitcoin, every 210,000 blocks,

894
00:28:45,874 --> 00:28:48,230
the miner reward that goes out to

895
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:50,549
each miner who successfully adds a block

896
00:28:50,559 --> 00:28:52,685
to the network gets cut in half.

897
00:28:52,686 --> 00:28:53,510
If you're a Bitcoin miner,

898
00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:55,350
there is a date coming up sometime

899
00:28:55,360 --> 00:28:56,310
in the next four years

900
00:28:56,320 --> 00:28:58,389
in which your income from helping

901
00:28:58,399 --> 00:28:59,669
contribute to the Bitcoin

902
00:28:59,679 --> 00:29:01,750
ecosystem gets cut in half.  If you're

903
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:03,350
doing mining for business this is a

904
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:05,029
rather disruptive thing.

905
00:29:05,039 --> 00:29:06,870
This is something in which Monero has

906
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:08,870
looked at the granddaddy cryptocurrency,

907
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:10,789
thought about what they're doing, and

908
00:29:10,799 --> 00:29:12,149
trying something a little different that

909
00:29:12,159 --> 00:29:13,786
might help matters a bit.

910
00:29:13,787 --> 00:29:15,110
And so in Monero the

911
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:17,350
emission is continually decreasing so we

912
00:29:17,360 --> 00:29:19,909
are spared from this drama in Bitcoin of

913
00:29:19,910 --> 00:29:22,080
having an every-four-year disruption

914
00:29:22,081 --> 00:29:25,269
thrown in to the mining ecosystem.

915
00:29:25,279 --> 00:29:26,791
There's a form of unwanted scarcity,

916
00:29:26,792 --> 00:29:30,026
and that is future miner rewards.

917
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:33,110
In Bitcoin, the miner reward is cut in

918
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:35,839
half every four years, as I just explained.

919
00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:38,310
What that means is that in, say, 40 years

920
00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:40,070
from now, the bitcoin reward

921
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:42,174
is going to be one-half to the 10th power,

922
00:29:42,175 --> 00:29:45,112
that's about 1/1000th of what it is now.

923
00:29:45,113 --> 00:29:46,870
This brings up a concern:  are

924
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:49,110
miners in the Bitcoin network -- in that

925
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:50,470
length of time from now -- are they going

926
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:52,149
to find that to be enough incentive to

927
00:29:52,159 --> 00:29:54,149
keep working for the network?  There's

928
00:29:54,159 --> 00:29:55,909
some academic research that shows that

929
00:29:55,919 --> 00:29:57,590
the solution that Bitcoin has come up

930
00:29:57,600 --> 00:30:00,149
with -- which is to institute a fee market

931
00:30:00,159 --> 00:30:02,230
in which the people who transact end up

932
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:03,914
engaging in a auction-like process

933
00:30:03,915 --> 00:30:07,278
process to bid up the fee that they offer --

934
00:30:07,279 --> 00:30:09,510
that that idea may not be enough to

935
00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:11,510
incentivize miners in the future.

936
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:13,269
In Monero what we have what we call

937
00:30:13,279 --> 00:30:14,630
the tail emission,

938
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:16,230
that is, that the block reward is never

939
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:18,925
going to be less than 0.3 Monero per minute.

940
00:30:18,926 --> 00:30:21,190
Over time, the number of Monero in

941
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:22,950
existence is going to linearly

942
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:26,310
increase forever.  This gets portrayed as

943
00:30:26,320 --> 00:30:28,549
being "infinite emission" by

944
00:30:28,559 --> 00:30:30,470
people who are not thinking about it

945
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:32,310
very, I would say, fairly.

946
00:30:32,320 --> 00:30:35,519
The reason is that the absolute value of emission

947
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:37,750
is not relevant in any macroeconomic

948
00:30:37,760 --> 00:30:39,990
theory.  Any macroeconomic theory that

949
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:41,830
takes into account what the money supply

950
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:43,350
is and the effects of changes in that

951
00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:45,190
money supply in the macroeconomy

952
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:47,430
will look at the percentage increase of

953
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:48,549
that money supply.

954
00:30:48,559 --> 00:30:50,549
So it's not the absolute value of U.S.

955
00:30:50,559 --> 00:30:52,630
dollars increasing that's relevant, it's

956
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:54,560
the percentage increase in U.S. dollars

957
00:30:54,561 --> 00:30:56,639
that's relevant.  And if you have

958
00:30:56,640 --> 00:30:58,630
a money supply, like Monero, that is

959
00:30:58,640 --> 00:31:00,950
increasing linearly over time --

960
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:02,592
every year, the money supply

961
00:31:02,593 --> 00:31:03,990
is going to expand by a

962
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:06,149
fixed constant amount -- which is what

963
00:31:06,159 --> 00:31:07,909
linear expansion just means --

964
00:31:07,919 --> 00:31:09,590
but that's going to be added to a

965
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:11,350
pre-existing base of monero

966
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:12,749
that is going to be growing.

967
00:31:12,750 --> 00:31:14,549
Therefore the inflation rate

968
00:31:14,559 --> 00:31:16,070
in percentage terms is going to be

969
00:31:16,080 --> 00:31:17,990
decreasing and asymptotically going

970
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:20,310
to zero.  Which means that that is the

971
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:22,230
relevant input to any macroeconomic

972
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:23,850
theory that uses the expansion

973
00:31:23,851 --> 00:31:25,115
of the money supply --

974
00:31:25,116 --> 00:31:26,950
an asymptotically zero

975
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:29,509
inflation rate -- and so to claim that

976
00:31:29,519 --> 00:31:31,726
identically zero inflation rate

977
00:31:31,727 --> 00:31:33,577
is a totally different situation

978
00:31:33,578 --> 00:31:35,934
than an asymptotically zero inflation rate

979
00:31:35,935 --> 00:31:38,398
is silly.  It's just not factual.

980
00:31:38,399 --> 00:31:40,870
It is easy to understand that 21 million

981
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:42,207
Bitcoin is the only amount

982
00:31:42,208 --> 00:31:43,430
that's ever going to be created,

983
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:45,350
but it leads to a bit of a laziness of

984
00:31:45,360 --> 00:31:47,110
thinking in which one comes to this

985
00:31:47,120 --> 00:31:49,350
false conclusion that one must have

986
00:31:49,360 --> 00:31:51,522
a identically zero inflation rate

987
00:31:51,523 --> 00:31:55,029
in order to be macroeconomically negligible.

988
00:31:55,039 --> 00:31:56,789
What do we gain in Monero for having

989
00:31:56,799 --> 00:31:58,549
this tail emission?  We know

990
00:31:58,559 --> 00:32:00,470
in Monero that miner incentives are

991
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:01,990
going to be there in perpetuity.

992
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:04,789
In Monero, we do not have a civil war

993
00:32:04,790 --> 00:32:07,110
over who is going to be paying for miner

994
00:32:07,120 --> 00:32:08,470
rewards in the future.

995
00:32:08,480 --> 00:32:10,230
Now this sounds like it might be trivial

996
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:12,230
and academic, but this whole position

997
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:14,149
in Bitcoin that we are going to get the

998
00:32:14,159 --> 00:32:16,789
transactors of Bitcoin to engage in this

999
00:32:16,799 --> 00:32:18,789
fee market -- the viability of that was

1000
00:32:18,799 --> 00:32:20,149
debated within Bitcoin

1001
00:32:20,159 --> 00:32:21,750
and was one of the factors leading to

1002
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:25,199
the divorce of Bitcoin versus Bitcoin Cash.

1003
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:27,190
We avoid all that in Monero by having

1004
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:29,509
this tail emission.

1005
00:32:29,519 --> 00:32:31,029
Here are some charts that show what I'm

1006
00:32:31,039 --> 00:32:33,029
talking about.  I'm looking at a time

1007
00:32:33,039 --> 00:32:35,430
scale of 2009, going out 15 years into

1008
00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:37,509
the future to the year 2035.

1009
00:32:37,519 --> 00:32:39,750
There have been about 18 million bitcoin

1010
00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:41,350
created and they're going to be three

1011
00:32:41,360 --> 00:32:42,549
million more created

1012
00:32:42,559 --> 00:32:45,750
for the rest of time.  In Monero, we also

1013
00:32:45,760 --> 00:32:47,110
have a predefined

1014
00:32:47,120 --> 00:32:49,029
schedule for what the coin emission is

1015
00:32:49,039 --> 00:32:50,389
going to be over time.  And so

1016
00:32:50,399 --> 00:32:52,950
to the left of August 2020, you see what

1017
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:55,359
actually happened in terms of emission in the

1018
00:32:55,360 --> 00:32:56,950
Monero blockchain up to now,

1019
00:32:56,960 --> 00:32:58,630
and then in the future you can see the

1020
00:32:58,640 --> 00:33:00,950
tail emission in Monero shows up as a

1021
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:02,789
straight line that's slightly tilted up

1022
00:33:02,799 --> 00:33:04,710
to the right -- that's the tail emission in

1023
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:06,310
which there's going to be a fixed number

1024
00:33:06,320 --> 00:33:08,779
of Monero dedicated to be given out

1025
00:33:08,780 --> 00:33:11,029
to miners every year, in perpetuity.

1026
00:33:11,039 --> 00:33:13,029
This differs from Bitcoin, in which they

1027
00:33:13,039 --> 00:33:14,950
have a problem to deal with, which is,

1028
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:16,630
how do they guarantee that the miners in

1029
00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:17,750
the far future are going to be

1030
00:33:17,760 --> 00:33:19,110
incentivized to keep

1031
00:33:19,120 --> 00:33:20,789
using their electricity to keep

1032
00:33:20,799 --> 00:33:22,773
supporting their network?

1033
00:33:23,890 --> 00:33:25,765
This is year-over-year supply inflation:

1034
00:33:25,766 --> 00:33:27,830
how much U.S. dollars have there been

1035
00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:29,509
versus how much U.S. dollars have there

1036
00:33:29,519 --> 00:33:31,669
been a year ago, at the same date.

1037
00:33:31,679 --> 00:33:34,310
We have a scary situation with the money

1038
00:33:34,320 --> 00:33:36,070
supply of the U.S. dollar.

1039
00:33:36,080 --> 00:33:37,750
As a result of the pandemic, this has

1040
00:33:37,760 --> 00:33:40,230
spiked up to about 30 percent.

1041
00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:41,509
Hopefully it works out for the best,

1042
00:33:41,519 --> 00:33:43,190
because if it doesn't, there's going to

1043
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:46,024
be a lot of suffering by humanity --

1044
00:33:46,025 --> 00:33:48,639
but the situation is what it is.

1045
00:33:48,640 --> 00:33:50,710
For those people looking for a source of

1046
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:53,506
scarcity that is gold or gold-like --

1047
00:33:53,507 --> 00:33:54,631
this is what you're looking at:

1048
00:33:54,632 --> 00:33:55,763
you have gold and you have

1049
00:33:55,764 --> 00:33:57,509
new digital alternatives in the form of

1050
00:33:57,519 --> 00:33:59,430
Bitcoin and Monero.

1051
00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:01,750
The World Gold Council keeps track of

1052
00:34:01,760 --> 00:34:03,830
its estimate of how much above-ground

1053
00:34:03,840 --> 00:34:06,310
gold there is in the world every year,

1054
00:34:06,320 --> 00:34:08,389
and that has been increasing at a pretty

1055
00:34:08,399 --> 00:34:11,349
constant rate about 1.8 percent per year.

1056
00:34:11,359 --> 00:34:13,296
If you use that as your litmus test,

1057
00:34:13,297 --> 00:34:15,190
a working definition of sound money would be

1058
00:34:15,200 --> 00:34:16,790
a source of scarcity that

1059
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:20,790
inflates by 1.8 percent per year, or less.

1060
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:23,190
Bitcoin and Monero both are coming up on

1061
00:34:23,200 --> 00:34:24,950
a new era of scarcity.

1062
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:27,030
The inflation rates of both Bitcoin and

1063
00:34:27,040 --> 00:34:29,510
Monero are going to be lower than gold,

1064
00:34:29,520 --> 00:34:32,399
so both will satisfy that definition of sound money --

1065
00:34:32,400 --> 00:34:35,223
a digital form of sound money.

1066
00:34:35,676 --> 00:34:37,190
There's another form of unwanted

1067
00:34:37,200 --> 00:34:38,340
scarcity that I want to talk about:

1068
00:34:38,341 --> 00:34:40,710
that is, mining hardware.

1069
00:34:40,720 --> 00:34:42,149
In the Bitcoin white paper there's this

1070
00:34:42,159 --> 00:34:43,750
phrase, "one CPU, one vote" --

1071
00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:45,990
and what that means is that you want to

1072
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:47,990
have every miner's probability of

1073
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:49,829
hitting a block reward be proportional

1074
00:34:49,839 --> 00:34:51,829
to the investment that they put in to

1075
00:34:51,839 --> 00:34:53,430
securing the network.

1076
00:34:53,440 --> 00:34:55,669
Now unfortunately, silicon economies of

1077
00:34:55,679 --> 00:34:58,069
scale destroy this linearity.

1078
00:34:58,079 --> 00:35:01,279
If you have an algorithm that is simple enough

1079
00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:03,349
that you can design a piece of silicon

1080
00:35:03,359 --> 00:35:04,550
to do nothing but

1081
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:07,190
that algorithm super efficiently, then

1082
00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:09,109
you'll have an advantage over general

1083
00:35:09,119 --> 00:35:11,910
purpose computing devices like CPUs.

1084
00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:14,294
In Bitcoin, you have exactly this situation.

1085
00:35:14,295 --> 00:35:15,910
So the proof of work algorithm

1086
00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:18,230
in Bitcoin is simple enough that ASICs got

1087
00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:20,550
custom designed to do nothing but the

1088
00:35:20,560 --> 00:35:23,919
Bitcoin proof-of-work algorithm over and over.

1089
00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:25,910
And unfortunately, all of the requisite

1090
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:28,069
hardware happens to be all made in China,

1091
00:35:28,079 --> 00:35:29,670
so Bitcoin mining currently is a

1092
00:35:29,680 --> 00:35:32,069
Chinese-dominated oligopoly.

1093
00:35:32,079 --> 00:35:33,750
This is not necessarily a problem that

1094
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:35,589
it's China;  the problem is that it's just

1095
00:35:35,599 --> 00:35:37,589
one part of the world that effectively

1096
00:35:37,590 --> 00:35:40,230
has a monopoly on the production of the

1097
00:35:40,240 --> 00:35:42,150
necessary equipment to maintain the

1098
00:35:42,160 --> 00:35:44,069
accounting system.

1099
00:35:44,079 --> 00:35:46,390
At this point, if you are just a regular

1100
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:47,909
guy with a gaming computer

1101
00:35:47,910 --> 00:35:49,109
at home, and you want to

1102
00:35:49,119 --> 00:35:50,310
join that to the Bitcoin

1103
00:35:50,320 --> 00:35:52,390
network and try to see if you can maybe

1104
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:54,390
hit a block -- you have a higher chance of

1105
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:56,230
winning the lotto than getting a Bitcoin

1106
00:35:56,240 --> 00:35:57,670
block reward.  It's not worth your time,

1107
00:35:57,680 --> 00:35:59,349
it's not worth the extra electricity

1108
00:35:59,359 --> 00:36:00,870
that your computer is going to eat while

1109
00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:02,550
it's trying to come up with blocks to

1110
00:36:02,560 --> 00:36:04,470
satisfy the Bitcoin network.

1111
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:07,030
So in Monero, we have taken steps to try

1112
00:36:07,031 --> 00:36:09,829
to keep the proof of work algorithm viable

1113
00:36:09,839 --> 00:36:11,910
for small independent miners who don't

1114
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:14,959
necessarily have, for example, 50 million dollars to

1115
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:17,030
spend on their own silicon fabrication

1116
00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:20,310
facility, or have social inroads with the

1117
00:36:20,320 --> 00:36:22,470
CEOs of the companies who do have these

1118
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:25,097
silicon fabs.  If you look at the

1119
00:36:25,098 --> 00:36:26,470
proof of work of Monero since

1120
00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:29,174
2018, it has changed four times.

1121
00:36:29,175 --> 00:36:30,870
It started out as Cryptonight, then

1122
00:36:30,880 --> 00:36:32,950
Cryptonight v2 came, Cryptonight v3, then

1123
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:35,990
Cryptonight-R, and now RandomX.

1124
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:37,910
To support that narrative, this is a

1125
00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:39,910
chart of the Monero network difficulty,

1126
00:36:39,920 --> 00:36:41,910
2014 to the present.

1127
00:36:41,920 --> 00:36:44,390
So through version 0.11 of Monero, the

1128
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:45,430
proof of work was

1129
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:47,430
Cryptonight.  You can see that the

1130
00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:48,710
difficulty was

1131
00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:50,550
proceeding along for several years, and

1132
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:51,750
then there's a spike

1133
00:36:51,760 --> 00:36:54,390
upwards, interpreted as ASICs coming onto

1134
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:55,750
the system.

1135
00:36:55,760 --> 00:36:57,750
There were chip manufacturers who looked

1136
00:36:57,760 --> 00:36:58,950
at the Monero proof of work,

1137
00:36:58,960 --> 00:37:01,030
figured out how to program the Monero

1138
00:37:01,040 --> 00:37:02,630
proof of work into a custom piece of

1139
00:37:02,640 --> 00:37:04,470
silicon, make that piece of silicon,

1140
00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:06,150
plug it into the network, and then start

1141
00:37:06,160 --> 00:37:07,910
getting a disproportionate share of

1142
00:37:07,920 --> 00:37:09,190
las recompensas del bloque.

1143
00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:10,630
Una vez que esto sucedió, hubo cierta alarma

1144
00:37:10,640 --> 00:37:12,390
in the Monero community, so work

1145
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:14,150
commenced on a variant

1146
00:37:14,160 --> 00:37:16,390
of the Cryptonight proof of work.  So

1147
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:17,510
Cryptonight v2

1148
00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:19,510
was developed, and tested, and then

1149
00:37:19,520 --> 00:37:20,870
deployed on the network.

1150
00:37:20,880 --> 00:37:22,069
When that happened you can see the

1151
00:37:22,079 --> 00:37:24,310
difficulty took a nosedive, because all

1152
00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:26,150
these ASICs that were previously

1153
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:27,910
viable and collecting a lot of the block

1154
00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:29,510
reward were now shut out, because the

1155
00:37:29,520 --> 00:37:31,910
proof of work changed on them.

1156
00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:33,349
Several months later, there was another

1157
00:37:33,359 --> 00:37:34,950
upward spike in the difficulty --

1158
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:36,630
there's a several month lead time from

1159
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:38,069
the time that you design an

1160
00:37:38,079 --> 00:37:39,589
ASIC to the time that you actually

1161
00:37:39,599 --> 00:37:41,670
fabricate it in enough quantity to make a

1162
00:37:41,680 --> 00:37:43,030
big dent on the network --

1163
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:45,270
so that was ASICs coming back online.  So

1164
00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:47,109
Cryptonight was patched again.

1165
00:37:47,119 --> 00:37:49,349
So again there was another hard fork in

1166
00:37:49,359 --> 00:37:51,750
late 2018 to change to Cryptonight v3.

1167
00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:53,670
That worked for another few months.  Then

1168
00:37:53,680 --> 00:37:55,589
the difficulty spiked up again.

1169
00:37:55,599 --> 00:37:57,190
And then there was Cryptonight-R --

1170
00:37:57,200 --> 00:37:59,109
mercifully, there was this silence from

1171
00:37:59,119 --> 00:38:00,790
the ASIC manufacturer.

1172
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:02,150
And then finally, there was a

1173
00:38:02,160 --> 00:38:04,150
revolutionary change in the

1174
00:38:04,160 --> 00:38:05,670
proof-of-work algorithm to RandomX

1175
00:38:05,680 --> 00:38:07,829
which uses a randomly generated

1176
00:38:07,839 --> 00:38:10,390
algorithm that must be executed in order

1177
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:11,750
to do the proof of work.

1178
00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:13,910
It uses not only integer operations but

1179
00:38:13,920 --> 00:38:15,589
even floating point operations, and so

1180
00:38:15,599 --> 00:38:16,710
it's a very interesting

1181
00:38:16,720 --> 00:38:19,037
example of a proof-of-work algorithm --

1182
00:38:19,038 --> 00:38:20,310
for which

1183
00:38:20,320 --> 00:38:22,870
the customized piece of silicon that

1184
00:38:22,880 --> 00:38:24,710
will do RandomX the best

1185
00:38:24,720 --> 00:38:27,349
happens to be an AMD Ryzen Threadripper,

1186
00:38:27,359 --> 00:38:29,598
which is something that you can buy on Amazon.

1187
00:38:29,599 --> 00:38:32,230
Commodity hardware is the most efficient

1188
00:38:32,240 --> 00:38:34,230
at doing the Monero proof of work.

1189
00:38:34,240 --> 00:38:36,470
These ASIC manufacturers do not have the

1190
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:38,630
most honest reputation, shall we say, of

1191
00:38:38,640 --> 00:38:40,230
immediately shipping their product out

1192
00:38:40,240 --> 00:38:42,069
once a customer buys an ASIC.

1193
00:38:42,079 --> 00:38:44,310
There tends to be a several month lag

1194
00:38:44,320 --> 00:38:46,230
due to, you know, "testing" --

1195
00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:48,150
and why would a ASIC manufacturer want

1196
00:38:48,160 --> 00:38:50,479
to delay shipment of product that's been paid for?

1197
00:38:50,480 --> 00:38:52,310
Well, they want to collect Bitcoin block

1198
00:38:52,320 --> 00:38:53,990
rewards with their customers' hardware

1199
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:55,349
before they send it out.

1200
00:38:55,359 --> 00:38:57,030
So that's the shenanigans that one has

1201
00:38:57,040 --> 00:38:58,790
to deal with when one does not have

1202
00:38:58,800 --> 00:39:01,190
a commodity piece of hardware to do

1203
00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:03,109
proof of work.

1204
00:39:03,119 --> 00:39:05,589
Since RandomX has gone into effect, what

1205
00:39:05,599 --> 00:39:07,349
is meant by a hash

1206
00:39:07,359 --> 00:39:09,589
now is different in RandomX versus

1207
00:39:09,599 --> 00:39:11,030
Cryptonight, so there's a

1208
00:39:11,040 --> 00:39:13,270
one-time jump in the difficulty which is

1209
00:39:13,280 --> 00:39:15,190
meaningless -- but since RandomX went in,

1210
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:17,238
all signs have been that CPUs have,

1211
00:39:17,239 --> 00:39:20,159
once again, been dominating the network.

1212
00:39:20,160 --> 00:39:22,790
There's been an enormous level of effort

1213
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:23,910
that's gone into this.

1214
00:39:23,920 --> 00:39:26,340
This is remarkable for any cryptocurrency.

1215
00:39:26,341 --> 00:39:28,069
It's a testament to the

1216
00:39:28,079 --> 00:39:30,470
persistence, and really, the unanimity of

1217
00:39:30,480 --> 00:39:32,630
the Monero community in having this goal

1218
00:39:32,640 --> 00:39:33,750
of something that's actually

1219
00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:35,190
decentralized in practice,

1220
00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:37,510
with small independent miners having a

1221
00:39:37,520 --> 00:39:40,312
shot at getting a block reward in Monero.

1222
00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:42,950
Another form of unwanted scarcity is

1223
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:44,310
access to layer one.

1224
00:39:44,320 --> 00:39:45,990
Bitcoin's one megabyte block limit

1225
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:47,750
caused a project fork.

1226
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:49,829
There is a controversy as to whether

1227
00:39:49,839 --> 00:39:51,910
this line of code which Satoshi had put

1228
00:39:51,911 --> 00:39:53,317
into the Bitcoin client,

1229
00:39:53,318 --> 00:39:55,270
saying that blocks have to be no

1230
00:39:55,280 --> 00:39:57,030
larger than one megabyte in size,

1231
00:39:57,040 --> 00:39:59,030
which is something that Satoshi did as a

1232
00:39:59,040 --> 00:40:01,190
kludgy way of preventing the network

1233
00:40:01,200 --> 00:40:03,190
from getting spammed.

1234
00:40:03,200 --> 00:40:05,030
The idea that there's going to be a hard

1235
00:40:05,040 --> 00:40:06,630
block limit that doesn't change has

1236
00:40:06,640 --> 00:40:09,104
survived in Bitcoin -- at least, in the dominant

1237
00:40:09,105 --> 00:40:11,439
post-divorce implementation of Bitcoin.

1238
00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:13,510
I'm showing a exponential scale, so this

1239
00:40:13,520 --> 00:40:15,270
is 10 transactions a day on the bottom

1240
00:40:15,280 --> 00:40:17,519
to a million transactions a day on the top.

1241
00:40:17,520 --> 00:40:18,870
In Bitcoin you can see that the

1242
00:40:18,880 --> 00:40:20,630
transactions per day in Bitcoin have

1243
00:40:20,640 --> 00:40:22,150
asymptotically hit a ceiling, and that is

1244
00:40:22,160 --> 00:40:24,630
due to this one megabyte block limit.

1245
00:40:24,640 --> 00:40:26,069
Again in Monero, we look at what's

1246
00:40:26,079 --> 00:40:27,589
happening in the granddaddy

1247
00:40:27,599 --> 00:40:28,550
cryptocurrency,

1248
00:40:28,560 --> 00:40:30,790
and give it all due respect as the first

1249
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:32,069
to exist -- but we're

1250
00:40:32,079 --> 00:40:33,990
looking at what could be done as an

1251
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:35,750
alternative solution to some of these

1252
00:40:35,760 --> 00:40:38,309
issues.  And so in Monero, we use what is

1253
00:40:38,319 --> 00:40:39,910
called an adaptive block weight --

1254
00:40:39,920 --> 00:40:41,349
it used to be called the adaptive block

1255
00:40:41,359 --> 00:40:42,950
size but there were modifications to the

1256
00:40:42,960 --> 00:40:44,069
algorithm so now it's called the

1257
00:40:44,079 --> 00:40:45,430
adaptive block weight --

1258
00:40:45,440 --> 00:40:47,349
the basic idea is that there is no

1259
00:40:47,359 --> 00:40:50,479
hard-coded limit on the size of a Monero block.

1260
00:40:50,480 --> 00:40:52,390
There is a miner disincentive that kicks

1261
00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:54,030
in when blocks get too big -- so that

1262
00:40:54,040 --> 00:40:56,309
disincentivizes miners from including

1263
00:40:56,319 --> 00:40:59,358
a whole bunch of transactions into a block.

1264
00:40:59,359 --> 00:41:01,190
There are user fees that also increase

1265
00:41:01,200 --> 00:41:03,190
if the blocks get too big.

1266
00:41:03,200 --> 00:41:05,990
The size can dynamically expand if there

1267
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:07,430
is organic growth

1268
00:41:07,440 --> 00:41:09,990
in the demand for Monero transactions.

1269
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:11,049
From this past history

1270
00:41:11,050 --> 00:41:12,309
of transactions per day, you

1271
00:41:12,319 --> 00:41:13,990
can make a pretty good argument that the

1272
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:15,750
trend line of this, transactions per day,

1273
00:41:15,760 --> 00:41:17,270
is on the way up.

1274
00:41:17,280 --> 00:41:19,349
It's unlikely to be spam related -- it's

1275
00:41:19,359 --> 00:41:21,519
unlikely that spammers are just carefully

1276
00:41:21,520 --> 00:41:23,030
spamming the network by just a little

1277
00:41:23,040 --> 00:41:24,950
bit and then increasing the amount of

1278
00:41:24,960 --> 00:41:27,030
spam that they send over time --

1279
00:41:27,040 --> 00:41:29,030
this seems to be organic growth in the

1280
00:41:29,040 --> 00:41:31,030
demand for Monero transactions.

1281
00:41:31,040 --> 00:41:33,750
[From] 2016 to this time today, that's a

1282
00:41:33,760 --> 00:41:35,910
10x increase in the transactions per day.

1283
00:41:35,920 --> 00:41:37,589
It doesn't look like much on this chart,

1284
00:41:37,599 --> 00:41:39,270
but that is quite significant.

1285
00:41:39,280 --> 00:41:40,630
In four years, at this pace, we're going

1286
00:41:40,640 --> 00:41:42,309
to be looking at a hundred thousand

1287
00:41:42,319 --> 00:41:43,109
transactions per day,

1288
00:41:43,119 --> 00:41:44,950
and then in the year 2028, maybe in

1289
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:45,990
DEF CON we'll be showing a million

1290
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:48,790
transactions a day, who knows.

1291
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:50,230
At this point of the talk I want to talk

1292
00:41:50,240 --> 00:41:52,069
about fungibility and transparency -- and

1293
00:41:52,079 --> 00:41:53,270
this is where the two

1294
00:41:53,280 --> 00:41:54,870
"mission statements" of these two

1295
00:41:54,880 --> 00:41:56,950
cryptocurrency projects start to diverge

1296
00:41:56,960 --> 00:41:58,710
quite strongly.

1297
00:41:58,720 --> 00:42:00,337
Bitcoin is transparent.

1298
00:42:00,338 --> 00:42:02,150
Etched forever for everyone to see,

1299
00:42:02,160 --> 00:42:04,230
is for every transaction, you can see the

1300
00:42:04,240 --> 00:42:06,150
sender the receiver and the amount;

1301
00:42:06,160 --> 00:42:07,829
for every address, you can see a complete

1302
00:42:07,839 --> 00:42:09,510
live balance history.

1303
00:42:09,520 --> 00:42:11,670
This is contrary to what you might have

1304
00:42:11,680 --> 00:42:13,430
heard from the popular press, if you're

1305
00:42:13,440 --> 00:42:15,670
new to getting into the real details of

1306
00:42:15,680 --> 00:42:17,589
cryptocurrency, because the news reports

1307
00:42:17,590 --> 00:42:19,990
always make Bitcoin out to be this anonymous

1308
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:22,159
currency that nobody knows anything about.

1309
00:42:22,160 --> 00:42:23,829
Nothing could be further from the truth --

1310
00:42:23,839 --> 00:42:25,910
it's actually completely transparent.

1311
00:42:25,920 --> 00:42:27,750
For high-net-worth clients that I work

1312
00:42:27,760 --> 00:42:29,190
with in my consulting practice,

1313
00:42:29,200 --> 00:42:30,707
this tends to be a show stopper,

1314
00:42:30,708 --> 00:42:32,230
once they know about it --

1315
00:42:32,240 --> 00:42:34,630
once they become aware of this fact, that

1316
00:42:34,640 --> 00:42:36,879
if you put a million dollars into Bitcoin,

1317
00:42:36,880 --> 00:42:38,550
as soon as they know your Bitcoin

1318
00:42:38,560 --> 00:42:40,309
address, anyone in the world

1319
00:42:40,319 --> 00:42:42,150
can go to their blockchain explorer, type

1320
00:42:42,160 --> 00:42:43,990
in that address and see there's 100

1321
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:46,298
bitcoin in there, that's worth a lot of money.

1322
00:42:46,299 --> 00:42:47,999
No one with wealth wants to

1323
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:49,406
broadcast that to the world --

1324
00:42:49,407 --> 00:42:52,059
it's just indiscreet, and it's unsafe.

1325
00:42:52,060 --> 00:42:54,639
So the fact that there's this transparency

1326
00:42:54,640 --> 00:42:57,270
in Bitcoin puts innocent people at risk.

1327
00:42:57,280 --> 00:42:58,550
Also, businesses -- because

1328
00:42:58,560 --> 00:43:00,470
businesses have, as part of their secret

1329
00:43:00,480 --> 00:43:01,750
sauce as to how they

1330
00:43:01,760 --> 00:43:03,557
are able to serve humanity and

1331
00:43:03,558 --> 00:43:05,270
make a profit at the same time --

1332
00:43:05,280 --> 00:43:07,030
is that they have a certain pattern of

1333
00:43:07,040 --> 00:43:09,030
suppliers they get their inputs from.

1334
00:43:09,040 --> 00:43:11,030
So often times, the prices of those

1335
00:43:11,040 --> 00:43:13,030
products might not be public knowledge.

1336
00:43:13,040 --> 00:43:14,309
There are lots of trade secrets that

1337
00:43:14,319 --> 00:43:17,199
businesses have and there's no shame in that --

1338
00:43:17,200 --> 00:43:19,349
for some reason, for some people, any sort

1339
00:43:19,359 --> 00:43:21,589
of desire for privacy gets portrayed as

1340
00:43:21,599 --> 00:43:23,670
being something nefarious.

1341
00:43:23,680 --> 00:43:25,750
Businesses routinely need privacy in

1342
00:43:25,760 --> 00:43:27,750
order to survive as businesses, in order

1343
00:43:27,751 --> 00:43:29,750
for their intellectual property, their trade

1344
00:43:29,760 --> 00:43:33,270
secrets, to not be copied by competitors.

1345
00:43:33,280 --> 00:43:36,559
Another problem in Bitcoin that goes beyond

1346
00:43:36,560 --> 00:43:39,670
privacy is fungibility.  Every coin in the

1347
00:43:39,680 --> 00:43:42,159
Bitcoin network is traceable back to the miner.

1348
00:43:42,160 --> 00:43:44,150
So it's as if you have a $10 bill

1349
00:43:44,160 --> 00:43:45,620
and on the back of the $10 bill

1350
00:43:45,621 --> 00:43:47,430
there's a neat chart that shows

1351
00:43:47,440 --> 00:43:49,270
your bank account numbers, and the

1352
00:43:49,280 --> 00:43:50,230
account numbers of everyone

1353
00:43:50,240 --> 00:43:52,710
before you who had that $10 bill

1354
00:43:52,720 --> 00:43:54,470
going all the way back to the U.S.

1355
00:43:54,480 --> 00:43:57,510
Mint that fabricated the $10 bill.

1356
00:43:57,520 --> 00:43:59,190
It's even worse than that, because if it

1357
00:43:59,200 --> 00:44:00,550
were actually on a physical piece of paper

1358
00:44:00,560 --> 00:44:02,069
then the holder of the piece of paper

1359
00:44:02,079 --> 00:44:03,430
would be the only one who could see it.

1360
00:44:03,431 --> 00:44:05,510
In Bitcoin, everyone in the world can see that

1361
00:44:05,520 --> 00:44:07,270
transaction list for every piece of

1362
00:44:07,280 --> 00:44:09,670
currency that's in the entire system.

1363
00:44:09,680 --> 00:44:11,133
That invites voyeurism.

1364
00:44:11,134 --> 00:44:12,870
If you know a Bitcoin address

1365
00:44:12,880 --> 00:44:15,190
it's natural to go to a Bitcoin explorer

1366
00:44:15,200 --> 00:44:16,550
and type in the address and see how much

1367
00:44:16,560 --> 00:44:17,670
money is there and see how many

1368
00:44:17,680 --> 00:44:18,950
transactions they do.

1369
00:44:18,960 --> 00:44:21,030
I think it's a pernicious social effect

1370
00:44:21,040 --> 00:44:22,870
of this feature of the protocol --

1371
00:44:22,880 --> 00:44:25,292
it's normalized being nosy.

1372
00:44:25,293 --> 00:44:27,109
There's also guilt by association,

1373
00:44:27,119 --> 00:44:29,190
and this is far more serious.  There are

1374
00:44:29,200 --> 00:44:31,759
many companies in existence whose job it is

1375
00:44:31,760 --> 00:44:33,670
to try and associate names and faces

1376
00:44:33,680 --> 00:44:36,078
with every address in Bitcoin.  They're trying to

1377
00:44:36,079 --> 00:44:38,390
dox everyone on the Bitcoin network.  And

1378
00:44:38,400 --> 00:44:39,910
what do they do with that information?

1379
00:44:39,920 --> 00:44:41,589
They basically come up with the

1380
00:44:41,599 --> 00:44:43,750
equivalent of a social credit score.

1381
00:44:43,760 --> 00:44:47,199
Because every bitcoin in existence can be traced,

1382
00:44:47,200 --> 00:44:50,230
they can make a graph showing people

1383
00:44:50,240 --> 00:44:52,230
transacting money with each other, and if

1384
00:44:52,240 --> 00:44:53,664
any of these people happen to be a

1385
00:44:53,665 --> 00:44:55,030
"bad" person,

1386
00:44:55,040 --> 00:44:57,030
then those people who happen to have

1387
00:44:57,040 --> 00:44:58,870
exchanged money with that bad person are

1388
00:44:58,871 --> 00:45:00,870
now flagged as potentially being bad

1389
00:45:00,880 --> 00:45:03,030
themselves.  The problem with this

1390
00:45:03,040 --> 00:45:04,950
is that it's based on imperfect

1391
00:45:04,960 --> 00:45:08,950
information that is easy to misinterpret.

1392
00:45:08,960 --> 00:45:11,344
In contrast, Monero is fungible.

1393
00:45:11,345 --> 00:45:13,560
Every Monero is indistinguishable

1394
00:45:13,561 --> 00:45:15,358
from every other Monero.

1395
00:45:15,359 --> 00:45:16,630
There are three technologies that

1396
00:45:16,640 --> 00:45:18,147
promote this indistinguishability.

1397
00:45:18,148 --> 00:45:19,829
One is ring signatures,

1398
00:45:19,839 --> 00:45:22,230
those keep transacting senders private;

1399
00:45:22,240 --> 00:45:23,430
stealth addresses keep

1400
00:45:23,440 --> 00:45:25,993
transacting receivers private; and RingCT

1401
00:45:25,994 --> 00:45:28,879
keeps transaction amounts sent private.

1402
00:45:28,880 --> 00:45:31,349
When a person joins the Monero network

1403
00:45:31,359 --> 00:45:32,608
by downloading the software

1404
00:45:32,609 --> 00:45:34,309
at getmonero.org, and

1405
00:45:34,319 --> 00:45:35,750
running that on their computer, and

1406
00:45:35,760 --> 00:45:37,589
downloading a copy of the blockchain

1407
00:45:37,599 --> 00:45:39,270
from their peer miners,

1408
00:45:39,280 --> 00:45:41,270
then they are getting a complete history

1409
00:45:41,280 --> 00:45:42,950
of who sent what to who in Monero.

1410
00:45:42,960 --> 00:45:44,630
The difference is:  in Monero it's all

1411
00:45:44,640 --> 00:45:46,069
encrypted, because

1412
00:45:46,079 --> 00:45:48,470
by default, it's none of your business.

1413
00:45:48,480 --> 00:45:50,630
You will know that transactions happened;

1414
00:45:50,640 --> 00:45:52,230
you will know when they happened, and you

1415
00:45:52,240 --> 00:45:53,670
will know that they happened, but you

1416
00:45:53,680 --> 00:45:57,839
won't see the details of what happened.

1417
00:45:58,000 --> 00:45:59,990
Two of these three technologies were

1418
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:01,750
included in the original whitepaper

1419
00:46:01,760 --> 00:46:02,937
that defined Monero -- which is the

1420
00:46:02,938 --> 00:46:04,309
Cryptonote whitepaper --

1421
00:46:04,319 --> 00:46:06,550
but RingCT was not.  RingCT was a

1422
00:46:06,560 --> 00:46:08,069
innovation.  And the

1423
00:46:08,079 --> 00:46:09,750
history of how this got into the network

1424
00:46:09,760 --> 00:46:12,150
is an example of the dedication of this

1425
00:46:12,160 --> 00:46:14,790
group of people to put it in.  RingCT

1426
00:46:14,800 --> 00:46:16,550
required several ingredients to come to

1427
00:46:16,560 --> 00:46:17,990
fruition:  first it required

1428
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:20,150
original cryptographic research -- we're

1429
00:46:20,160 --> 00:46:21,910
talking postdoc, PhD

1430
00:46:21,920 --> 00:46:23,990
mathematician level cryptographic

1431
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:25,829
research -- that goes through audit and

1432
00:46:25,839 --> 00:46:26,870
peer review.

1433
00:46:26,880 --> 00:46:29,510
Second, you need development of code to

1434
00:46:29,520 --> 00:46:31,030
implement this new math.

1435
00:46:31,040 --> 00:46:33,030
The math is not trivial, and then to

1436
00:46:33,040 --> 00:46:34,950
write code that faithfully implements

1437
00:46:34,960 --> 00:46:37,270
that new math is also not trivial --

1438
00:46:37,280 --> 00:46:39,270
just in case there were problems in the

1439
00:46:39,280 --> 00:46:40,390
code that got written, it got

1440
00:46:40,400 --> 00:46:42,870
subject to external audit, so basically

1441
00:46:42,880 --> 00:46:44,309
the Monero community was

1442
00:46:44,319 --> 00:46:47,109
solicited for donations to pay for

1443
00:46:47,119 --> 00:46:49,919
external auditors to examine the code of RingCT

1444
00:46:49,920 --> 00:46:51,670
and make sure that there were no subtle

1445
00:46:51,680 --> 00:46:54,150
errors of memory overwrites or such,

1446
00:46:54,160 --> 00:46:57,030
and that got approved.  Then finally, it

1447
00:46:57,040 --> 00:46:58,790
doesn't matter if code gets written if

1448
00:46:58,800 --> 00:47:00,069
nobody actually runs it.

1449
00:47:00,079 --> 00:47:02,870
So the community of Monero node owners

1450
00:47:02,880 --> 00:47:04,300
needed to get on board

1451
00:47:04,301 --> 00:47:05,349
and download this and

1452
00:47:05,359 --> 00:47:07,109
update their computers once the new code

1453
00:47:07,119 --> 00:47:09,589
came out, because this was a hard fork.

1454
00:47:09,599 --> 00:47:11,109
So all these ingredients had to happen

1455
00:47:11,119 --> 00:47:12,996
for RingCT to go in.

1456
00:47:13,599 --> 00:47:15,349
On the top I'm showing daily average

1457
00:47:15,359 --> 00:47:16,870
bytes per transaction on both the

1458
00:47:16,880 --> 00:47:18,790
Bitcoin network and the Monero network.

1459
00:47:18,800 --> 00:47:20,870
Bitcoin is in black, and it's been pretty

1460
00:47:20,880 --> 00:47:22,150
constant over time.

1461
00:47:22,160 --> 00:47:23,670
That's part of their community ethos

1462
00:47:23,680 --> 00:47:25,418
over at Bitcoin, is that they want a stable

1463
00:47:25,419 --> 00:47:27,679
protocol, they don't want to rock the boat.

1464
00:47:27,680 --> 00:47:29,910
In Monero, we are used to acknowledging

1465
00:47:29,920 --> 00:47:31,190
that they're going to be new research,

1466
00:47:31,200 --> 00:47:33,589
new innovations that make fungibility

1467
00:47:33,599 --> 00:47:35,863
even better -- and we go through

1468
00:47:35,864 --> 00:47:37,270
the time and the trouble and the effort

1469
00:47:37,271 --> 00:47:38,988
to actually make that happen.

1470
00:47:38,989 --> 00:47:41,190
In the birth days of Monero, you

1471
00:47:41,200 --> 00:47:43,349
see that the transaction size in bytes

1472
00:47:43,359 --> 00:47:44,950
was very small, because those were mostly

1473
00:47:44,960 --> 00:47:46,870
coinbase transactions going out to

1474
00:47:46,880 --> 00:47:49,670
empty blocks.  But then people started

1475
00:47:49,680 --> 00:47:51,270
using it, and then in the early days of

1476
00:47:51,280 --> 00:47:52,870
Monero the system used

1477
00:47:52,880 --> 00:47:55,349
denominated outputs.  You can think of

1478
00:47:55,359 --> 00:47:58,307
there being like a one-Monero gold chunk

1479
00:47:58,308 --> 00:48:01,305
that is encased in plastic and it's engraved

1480
00:48:01,306 --> 00:48:04,159
with the owner's key information on it.

1481
00:48:04,160 --> 00:48:06,230
Once a person spends that one-Monero

1482
00:48:06,240 --> 00:48:08,470
output, then it transmits, and it becomes

1483
00:48:08,480 --> 00:48:09,990
the property of somebody else on the

1484
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:11,190
Monero network.

1485
00:48:11,200 --> 00:48:12,950
And so, in the early days of Monero, you

1486
00:48:12,960 --> 00:48:14,870
had every round number -- so you had

1487
00:48:14,880 --> 00:48:16,390
1 through 9, 10 through 90,

1488
00:48:16,400 --> 00:48:18,858
100 through 900 -- and then going the other way:

1489
00:48:18,859 --> 00:48:22,549
0.1 through 0.9, 0.01 through 0.09...

1490
00:48:22,559 --> 00:48:24,069
and so as a result there were a large

1491
00:48:24,079 --> 00:48:25,750
number of inputs and a large number of

1492
00:48:25,760 --> 00:48:27,510
outputs on every transaction.

1493
00:48:27,520 --> 00:48:30,390
This was not so good for privacy, because

1494
00:48:30,400 --> 00:48:32,634
if you spend 341 Monero,

1495
00:48:32,635 --> 00:48:33,990
just to make up a number, you

1496
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:36,309
can see the 300 and the 40 and the 1,

1497
00:48:36,319 --> 00:48:37,990
you can see they're travelling around --

1498
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:39,670
that's what you could see in Monero

1499
00:48:39,680 --> 00:48:41,430
pre-RingCT.

1500
00:48:41,440 --> 00:48:43,270
And so, it was decided in the community

1501
00:48:43,280 --> 00:48:45,030
that this was not acceptable, and so when

1502
00:48:45,040 --> 00:48:46,710
the research for RingCT

1503
00:48:46,720 --> 00:48:48,549
was tested and vetted and also

1504
00:48:48,559 --> 00:48:49,990
externally audited

1505
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:51,430
there was a decision in the community to

1506
00:48:51,440 --> 00:48:53,829
do it.  Now, this was despite the fact that

1507
00:48:53,839 --> 00:48:55,910
when RingCT was enabled, you can see

1508
00:48:55,920 --> 00:48:58,262
there's this big jump in 2017

1509
00:48:58,263 --> 00:49:00,399
of the transaction size, so it went to about

1510
00:49:00,400 --> 00:49:02,235
10 kilobytes per transaction.

1511
00:49:02,236 --> 00:49:04,743
But that was a price that was decided in

1512
00:49:04,744 --> 00:49:06,879
the Monero community was worth it

1513
00:49:06,880 --> 00:49:08,998
to improve fungibility of the coin --

1514
00:49:08,999 --> 00:49:11,490
which would protect the innocent.

1515
00:49:11,920 --> 00:49:13,810
Then later, bulletproofs came --

1516
00:49:13,811 --> 00:49:15,349
more clever mathematics

1517
00:49:15,359 --> 00:49:19,118
to ensure that the balance of inputs and outputs,

1518
00:49:19,119 --> 00:49:22,479
that is guaranteed using higher math in RingCT,

1519
00:49:22,480 --> 00:49:24,470
can be done with far less byte space

1520
00:49:24,480 --> 00:49:26,549
than it previously did.

1521
00:49:26,559 --> 00:49:28,390
There's a research process, an audit

1522
00:49:28,400 --> 00:49:30,470
process, a coding process, and a vetting

1523
00:49:30,480 --> 00:49:32,424
process for all this for bulletproofs as well.

1524
00:49:32,425 --> 00:49:33,990
But when that went live on the network --

1525
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:35,910
that was in late 2018 -- you can see that

1526
00:49:35,920 --> 00:49:37,750
the transaction size dropped by

1527
00:49:37,760 --> 00:49:39,829
basically an order of magnitude.

1528
00:49:39,839 --> 00:49:40,870
And then you can see here on the

1529
00:49:40,880 --> 00:49:43,270
transaction fee side, the fees also dropped

1530
00:49:43,280 --> 00:49:45,510
by an order of magnitude.

1531
00:49:45,520 --> 00:49:46,950
You could argue that the Monero

1532
00:49:46,960 --> 00:49:48,549
transaction sizes are still quite a bit

1533
00:49:48,559 --> 00:49:50,069
larger than Bitcoin's,

1534
00:49:50,079 --> 00:49:52,230
but there's a new news item in the

1535
00:49:52,240 --> 00:49:54,069
Monero research pipeline --

1536
00:49:54,079 --> 00:49:57,430
CLSAGs are a way to compress the

1537
00:49:57,440 --> 00:49:59,190
byte size requirement of transactions

1538
00:49:59,200 --> 00:50:00,487
even further, on top of what

1539
00:50:00,488 --> 00:50:01,829
bulletproofs have done --

1540
00:50:01,839 --> 00:50:03,589
that just went through an audit process

1541
00:50:03,599 --> 00:50:05,270
and it's being coded up for

1542
00:50:05,280 --> 00:50:07,670
inclusion in the next hard fork.

1543
00:50:07,680 --> 00:50:09,750
In Monero, "hard fork" is not a term of

1544
00:50:09,760 --> 00:50:11,589
war;  it's something we look forward to

1545
00:50:11,599 --> 00:50:13,190
because it means that new good stuff is

1546
00:50:13,200 --> 00:50:14,870
going to come on live.

1547
00:50:14,880 --> 00:50:16,950
So CLSAGs are set to go live on the

1548
00:50:16,960 --> 00:50:18,309
network this October,

1549
00:50:18,319 --> 00:50:20,470
and once that happens, I'm showing in a

1550
00:50:20,480 --> 00:50:21,430
dotted line here

1551
00:50:21,440 --> 00:50:23,190
the magnitude of improvement that we're

1552
00:50:23,200 --> 00:50:25,349
expecting to see post-CLSAG.

1553
00:50:25,359 --> 00:50:27,190
There's a gap here between the

1554
00:50:27,200 --> 00:50:28,630
transaction sizes between Monero and

1555
00:50:28,631 --> 00:50:31,109
Bitcoin, but it's shrinking.  The reason it's

1556
00:50:31,119 --> 00:50:33,270
shrinking is that there is ongoing

1557
00:50:33,280 --> 00:50:35,430
active research in Monero to improve

1558
00:50:35,440 --> 00:50:37,430
the way the engine works under the hood.

1559
00:50:37,440 --> 00:50:39,190
This is the kind of thing that is

1560
00:50:39,200 --> 00:50:41,059
actually rare to see in other cryptocurrencies.

1561
00:50:41,060 --> 00:50:42,639
Other cryptocurrencies tend to

1562
00:50:42,640 --> 00:50:44,309
make big announcements, use lots of

1563
00:50:44,319 --> 00:50:45,670
buzzwords, and not

1564
00:50:45,680 --> 00:50:47,750
actually improve anything.  It's actually

1565
00:50:47,760 --> 00:50:49,030
the opposite in Monero --

1566
00:50:49,040 --> 00:50:51,829
people work quietly without fanfare, and

1567
00:50:51,839 --> 00:50:53,393
from time to time, introduce something

1568
00:50:53,394 --> 00:50:56,284
that improves the actual product.

1569
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:00,663
Monero benefits people with nothing to hide.

1570
00:51:00,664 --> 00:51:02,799
It does that by eliminating the risk

1571
00:51:02,800 --> 00:51:04,796
of receiving coins that are tainted,

1572
00:51:04,797 --> 00:51:06,790
due to no fault of the receiver.

1573
00:51:06,800 --> 00:51:07,843
So for example --

1574
00:51:07,844 --> 00:51:10,069
let's say you're selling your used car,

1575
00:51:10,079 --> 00:51:11,990
and the person who you sell your car to

1576
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:13,190
gives you bitcoin.

1577
00:51:13,200 --> 00:51:15,308
And, like everyone else who sells their car

1578
00:51:15,309 --> 00:51:17,759
to a stranger by posting an ad on Craigslist,

1579
00:51:17,760 --> 00:51:19,190
you didn't do a thorough background

1580
00:51:19,200 --> 00:51:21,109
check on this person who bought your car.

1581
00:51:21,119 --> 00:51:22,630
They had bitcoin, you had a car, you did

1582
00:51:22,640 --> 00:51:24,470
an exchange, you went on your way.

1583
00:51:24,480 --> 00:51:26,470
Unbeknownst to you, the way that they got

1584
00:51:26,480 --> 00:51:28,052
their bitcoin was that they were,

1585
00:51:28,053 --> 00:51:30,069
for example, selling drugs on the dark web --

1586
00:51:30,079 --> 00:51:31,349
and that's how they came up with that

1587
00:51:31,359 --> 00:51:33,349
bitcoin, which now you own, because you

1588
00:51:33,359 --> 00:51:35,270
sold your car to this person.

1589
00:51:35,280 --> 00:51:37,270
And now, because the companies that are

1590
00:51:37,280 --> 00:51:39,510
doing blockchain analysis know that --

1591
00:51:39,520 --> 00:51:41,990
now they are looking at you, thinking,

1592
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:43,990
"this person just got ten thousand dollars

1593
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:45,270
worth of bitcoin from

1594
00:51:45,280 --> 00:51:48,390
a known drug dealer... maybe this person is

1595
00:51:48,400 --> 00:51:50,150
supplying drug paraphernalia

1596
00:51:50,160 --> 00:51:53,030
to that dealer."  Now this person tries to

1597
00:51:53,040 --> 00:51:55,109
put their tainted bitcoin into a crypto

1598
00:51:55,119 --> 00:51:57,589
exchange to get USD out of it.

1599
00:51:57,599 --> 00:51:59,430
Once they send their tainted bitcoin to

1600
00:51:59,440 --> 00:52:01,030
their exchange, it gets frozen,

1601
00:52:01,040 --> 00:52:02,790
and now the customer has to go through

1602
00:52:02,800 --> 00:52:05,529
all sorts of extra hoops to prove their innocence.

1603
00:52:05,530 --> 00:52:07,109
And they're trying to prove their

1604
00:52:07,119 --> 00:52:08,710
innocence to somebody who really doesn't

1605
00:52:08,720 --> 00:52:10,390
care to know the truth --

1606
00:52:10,400 --> 00:52:11,910
they just want to cover liability on

1607
00:52:11,920 --> 00:52:13,270
their side, they just want to make sure

1608
00:52:13,280 --> 00:52:14,630
that they don't get in trouble.

1609
00:52:14,640 --> 00:52:16,150
The easiest thing to do is just to

1610
00:52:16,160 --> 00:52:17,829
quarantine that money, not give it back

1611
00:52:17,839 --> 00:52:19,270
to the customer, and wait for

1612
00:52:19,280 --> 00:52:20,790
the authorities to give them permission

1613
00:52:20,800 --> 00:52:23,109
to give it back.  And none of this had

1614
00:52:23,119 --> 00:52:24,790
anything to do with the innocent person

1615
00:52:24,800 --> 00:52:28,069
involved.  This is why the transparency of

1616
00:52:28,079 --> 00:52:29,349
Bitcoin is a problem --

1617
00:52:29,359 --> 00:52:31,510
even for innocent people who have

1618
00:52:31,520 --> 00:52:32,790
nothing to hide.

1619
00:52:32,800 --> 00:52:35,270
Because the system is transparent, false

1620
00:52:35,280 --> 00:52:37,270
accusations can be made against them

1621
00:52:37,280 --> 00:52:40,150
due to incomplete misunderstandings that

1622
00:52:40,160 --> 00:52:41,910
other third parties are making

1623
00:52:41,920 --> 00:52:44,300
based on that transaction data.

1624
00:52:44,301 --> 00:52:46,069
It's even worse than that.  So, for example,

1625
00:52:46,079 --> 00:52:48,069
let's say you're an owner of Bitcoin,

1626
00:52:48,079 --> 00:52:49,990
you're totally 100 percent squeaky clean,

1627
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:53,118
and you get hacked.  Somebody steals your bitcoin.

1628
00:52:53,119 --> 00:52:54,870
Let's say that the person who stole your

1629
00:52:54,880 --> 00:52:56,390
bitcoin now goes

1630
00:52:56,400 --> 00:52:58,148
on the dark web and spends it.

1631
00:52:58,149 --> 00:52:59,670
Now your address,

1632
00:52:59,680 --> 00:53:02,069
your identity, is associated with that.

1633
00:53:02,079 --> 00:53:04,479
You might be investigated for crimes that were

1634
00:53:04,480 --> 00:53:06,390
committed with your bitcoin that got

1635
00:53:06,400 --> 00:53:08,230
stolen.  And so, now,

1636
00:53:08,240 --> 00:53:09,750
not only are you suffering the loss of

1637
00:53:09,760 --> 00:53:11,349
your money, you're having to now

1638
00:53:11,359 --> 00:53:13,750
explain that "it's not the case that I

1639
00:53:13,760 --> 00:53:15,589
paid this guy to buy drugs for me,

1640
00:53:15,599 --> 00:53:18,470
I actually had my money stolen from me!"

1641
00:53:18,480 --> 00:53:20,192
For people who actually are

1642
00:53:20,193 --> 00:53:22,390
squeaky clean, any involvement

1643
00:53:22,400 --> 00:53:24,790
in the Bitcoin blockchain means you have

1644
00:53:24,800 --> 00:53:26,150
a probability of

1645
00:53:26,160 --> 00:53:28,069
interacting with somebody else on the

1646
00:53:28,079 --> 00:53:29,589
Bitcoin blockchain who is not as

1647
00:53:29,590 --> 00:53:30,950
squeaky clean as you are.

1648
00:53:30,960 --> 00:53:32,950
And if that happens, that's going to be

1649
00:53:32,960 --> 00:53:34,790
flagged in these companies

1650
00:53:34,800 --> 00:53:37,270
doing blockchain analysis as a link, when

1651
00:53:37,280 --> 00:53:39,591
the fact is, it's a false positive.

1652
00:53:39,592 --> 00:53:41,943
But you as the user have no power over that.

1653
00:53:41,944 --> 00:53:43,510
You have no recourse;  you have no way of

1654
00:53:43,520 --> 00:53:45,109
communicating to these companies and saying

1655
00:53:45,119 --> 00:53:47,430
"hey, yo, I'm actually squeaky clean."

1656
00:53:47,440 --> 00:53:50,480
They don't know.  They don't care.

1657
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:53,670
One way to look at this is in the Akerloff

1658
00:53:53,680 --> 00:53:55,510
framework.  So this was a Nobel Prize

1659
00:53:55,520 --> 00:53:56,722
winning paper in economics;

1660
00:53:56,723 --> 00:53:58,230
it has to do with used cars.

1661
00:53:58,240 --> 00:53:59,910
So first, I'll explain the paper, and then

1662
00:53:59,920 --> 00:54:01,430
I'll apply it, because it has

1663
00:54:01,440 --> 00:54:02,870
applications to both DEF CON

1664
00:54:02,880 --> 00:54:04,470
"Safe Mode," our virtual meeting that we're

1665
00:54:04,480 --> 00:54:06,230
doing -- and also a surveillance state with

1666
00:54:06,240 --> 00:54:07,589
transparent coins.

1667
00:54:07,599 --> 00:54:08,870
So there are two used car types:  there

1668
00:54:08,880 --> 00:54:10,790
are lemons and there are peaches.

1669
00:54:10,800 --> 00:54:11,990
Lemons are the cars that are going to

1670
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:14,710
break right away, and peaches are the

1671
00:54:14,720 --> 00:54:17,270
well-maintained used cars.  So sellers

1672
00:54:17,280 --> 00:54:18,950
know which type of car they have --

1673
00:54:18,960 --> 00:54:20,870
if you own a lemon, you know it, because

1674
00:54:20,880 --> 00:54:22,309
you were there in the hurricane when

1675
00:54:22,319 --> 00:54:23,270
your car was under

1676
00:54:23,280 --> 00:54:25,030
five feet of water and now you're trying

1677
00:54:25,040 --> 00:54:26,470
to sell your car because it's damaged,

1678
00:54:26,480 --> 00:54:27,270
that's a lemon --

1679
00:54:27,280 --> 00:54:29,109
a peach is a car with the type of owner

1680
00:54:29,119 --> 00:54:30,790
who changes the oil and does all the

1681
00:54:30,800 --> 00:54:32,150
maintenance that you have to do on a car

1682
00:54:32,160 --> 00:54:33,910
to keep it in good condition.

1683
00:54:33,920 --> 00:54:35,510
So the sellers know what kind of car

1684
00:54:35,520 --> 00:54:37,109
they have, but the buyers don't,

1685
00:54:37,119 --> 00:54:38,789
because both lemon sellers and peach

1686
00:54:38,799 --> 00:54:40,470
sellers make sure that the paint job on

1687
00:54:40,480 --> 00:54:42,154
their car is extra shiny.

1688
00:54:42,155 --> 00:54:43,670
On a superficial level,

1689
00:54:43,680 --> 00:54:45,270
both lemons and peaches look identical

1690
00:54:45,280 --> 00:54:47,109
to buyers.  So the buyers can't tell

1691
00:54:47,119 --> 00:54:48,870
lemons apart from peaches, but they know

1692
00:54:48,880 --> 00:54:50,470
that they are ignorant in this situation --

1693
00:54:50,480 --> 00:54:52,879
they know that they could end up with a lemon.

1694
00:54:52,880 --> 00:54:54,870
The Akerloff paper brilliantly

1695
00:54:54,880 --> 00:54:56,470
explains this race to the bottom that

1696
00:54:56,480 --> 00:54:58,390
happens in this asymmetric information

1697
00:54:58,400 --> 00:55:00,309
market in which buyers are armed with

1698
00:55:00,319 --> 00:55:02,789
less information than the sellers are.

1699
00:55:02,799 --> 00:55:04,870
What is the offer price that a buyer is

1700
00:55:04,880 --> 00:55:06,309
going to offer for a car?

1701
00:55:06,319 --> 00:55:07,349
At the minimum, you're going to be

1702
00:55:07,359 --> 00:55:09,430
offering the lemon price -- and then you're

1703
00:55:09,440 --> 00:55:11,190
going to offer more than the lemon price

1704
00:55:11,200 --> 00:55:13,999
contingent on what you think the probability is

1705
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:16,318
that you're going to get a peach versus a lemon.

1706
00:55:16,319 --> 00:55:17,829
So if you think there's a zero percent

1707
00:55:17,839 --> 00:55:19,109
chance you're going to get a peach -- well

1708
00:55:19,119 --> 00:55:19,990
you're just going to offer

1709
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:22,309
the lemon price.  If you think there's 100

1710
00:55:22,319 --> 00:55:23,750
percent chance that you're going to get a

1711
00:55:23,760 --> 00:55:25,670
peach, then you're going to offer the

1712
00:55:25,680 --> 00:55:26,950
lemon price plus the

1713
00:55:26,960 --> 00:55:28,390
difference between the peach and the

1714
00:55:28,400 --> 00:55:29,670
lemon price.  In other words, you'll offer

1715
00:55:29,680 --> 00:55:30,710
the peach price.

1716
00:55:30,720 --> 00:55:31,910
If you think the probability is

1717
00:55:31,920 --> 00:55:33,190
somewhere in between -- then you're going

1718
00:55:33,200 --> 00:55:34,309
to adjust your offer price to be

1719
00:55:34,319 --> 00:55:35,750
somewhere in between.

1720
00:55:35,760 --> 00:55:37,589
That's the offer price that a rational

1721
00:55:37,599 --> 00:55:39,349
buyer is going to offer for a car in

1722
00:55:39,359 --> 00:55:40,950
this market, in which they are ignorant,

1723
00:55:40,960 --> 00:55:42,309
but they know that they're ignorant, and

1724
00:55:42,319 --> 00:55:44,230
they can adjust their offer price to

1725
00:55:44,240 --> 00:55:46,193
account for this uncertainty.

1726
00:55:46,194 --> 00:55:47,887
So what do the lemon sellers do

1727
00:55:47,888 --> 00:55:49,838
when they see this price?  Well, they see

1728
00:55:49,839 --> 00:55:51,910
a great offer -- this sucker here is

1729
00:55:51,920 --> 00:55:53,670
offering quite a bit higher price than

1730
00:55:53,680 --> 00:55:54,470
the lemon price.

1731
00:55:54,480 --> 00:55:56,230
So the lemon seller is delighted -- they're

1732
00:55:56,240 --> 00:55:58,606
going to say, "Okay, I thought about it and

1733
00:55:58,607 --> 00:56:01,199
yeah, I guess I'll accept your offer."

1734
00:56:01,200 --> 00:56:01,990
The peach seller --

1735
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:03,409
they've done the maintenance on their car,

1736
00:56:03,410 --> 00:56:04,905
they know that the value of their car is

1737
00:56:04,906 --> 00:56:06,155
worth what a peach is --

1738
00:56:06,156 --> 00:56:07,771
but you can tell them all day

1739
00:56:07,772 --> 00:56:08,950
that you've done a great job of

1740
00:56:08,960 --> 00:56:10,470
maintaining your car, but the buyer,

1741
00:56:10,480 --> 00:56:11,670
at the end of the day, they're going to

1742
00:56:11,680 --> 00:56:12,870
be skeptical.  They don't know if you're

1743
00:56:12,880 --> 00:56:13,990
really telling them the truth.  They don't

1744
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:16,159
know if you're telling them the partial truth.

1745
00:56:16,160 --> 00:56:18,069
So the price that the buyer is going to

1746
00:56:18,079 --> 00:56:20,318
offer is less than that of the peach price.

1747
00:56:20,319 --> 00:56:21,260
And so what's going to happen then?

1748
00:56:21,261 --> 00:56:22,658
The peach sellers are going to

1749
00:56:22,659 --> 00:56:23,750
become discouraged.

1750
00:56:23,760 --> 00:56:25,510
They're going to be disappointed by the

1751
00:56:25,520 --> 00:56:26,960
fact that their moral goodness

1752
00:56:26,961 --> 00:56:28,230
in taking care of their car

1753
00:56:28,240 --> 00:56:29,829
is not going to be reflected in a high

1754
00:56:29,839 --> 00:56:30,660
market price.

1755
00:56:30,661 --> 00:56:31,706
So they will leave the market --

1756
00:56:31,707 --> 00:56:33,660
they will delete their Craigslist ad --

1757
00:56:33,661 --> 00:56:34,870
they will just keep their car

1758
00:56:34,880 --> 00:56:36,554
until it runs into the ground.

1759
00:56:36,555 --> 00:56:39,109
Now, a greater fraction of the cars

1760
00:56:39,119 --> 00:56:40,150
that are available for sale

1761
00:56:40,151 --> 00:56:41,322
are now lemons.

1762
00:56:41,323 --> 00:56:43,039
And eventually, buyers are

1763
00:56:43,040 --> 00:56:44,523
going to get wise to that fact.

1764
00:56:44,524 --> 00:56:45,750
When they get wise to that fact,

1765
00:56:45,760 --> 00:56:47,349
they're going to lower further

1766
00:56:47,359 --> 00:56:48,430
their offer price --

1767
00:56:48,431 --> 00:56:49,835
and thus, the negative

1768
00:56:49,836 --> 00:56:51,349
feedback loop is born.

1769
00:56:51,359 --> 00:56:53,510
Every time the offer price goes down,

1770
00:56:53,520 --> 00:56:54,710
more peach sellers are going to get

1771
00:56:54,720 --> 00:56:56,230
discouraged and leave the market.

1772
00:56:56,240 --> 00:56:58,069
You have a situation at the end where

1773
00:56:58,079 --> 00:57:00,687
only lemons exist in this car market.

1774
00:57:00,688 --> 00:57:01,510
So this was the

1775
00:57:01,520 --> 00:57:03,190
Akerloff paper that got the Nobel Prize.

1776
00:57:03,200 --> 00:57:05,394
Let's think about this in terms of the pandemic.

1777
00:57:05,395 --> 00:57:06,549
In health terms,

1778
00:57:06,559 --> 00:57:08,184
peaches are people who are healthy.

1779
00:57:08,185 --> 00:57:09,670
And they are now

1780
00:57:09,680 --> 00:57:10,984
faced with the decision of:

1781
00:57:10,985 --> 00:57:12,870
"do I engage in this

1782
00:57:12,880 --> 00:57:15,430
super thing called DEF CON, in which a

1783
00:57:15,440 --> 00:57:17,030
whole bunch of smart people get together,

1784
00:57:17,040 --> 00:57:18,950
and talk about cool geeky stuff,

1785
00:57:18,960 --> 00:57:21,270
and you make new geeky friends in Vegas

1786
00:57:21,280 --> 00:57:22,630
and have fun" --

1787
00:57:22,640 --> 00:57:24,390
basically, are you going to engage in

1788
00:57:24,400 --> 00:57:26,710
this social marketplace in which you are

1789
00:57:26,720 --> 00:57:28,418
dealing with other people?

1790
00:57:28,419 --> 00:57:29,589
You could be dealing with

1791
00:57:29,599 --> 00:57:31,122
all peaches when you get to the

1792
00:57:31,123 --> 00:57:32,470
live, in-person DEF CON --

1793
00:57:32,480 --> 00:57:35,030
that is, everyone could be healthy -- but

1794
00:57:35,040 --> 00:57:35,990
you are aware that

1795
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:36,898
that's not the case.

1796
00:57:36,899 --> 00:57:37,764
There are going to be some lemons.

1797
00:57:37,765 --> 00:57:38,906
There are going to be some people

1798
00:57:38,907 --> 00:57:40,843
who are sick, and don't know it,

1799
00:57:40,844 --> 00:57:42,549
because of the nature of the virus.

1800
00:57:42,559 --> 00:57:45,910
So you have to gauge your overall social

1801
00:57:45,920 --> 00:57:47,510
utility of going to the conference

1802
00:57:47,520 --> 00:57:48,950
by the probability that you're going to

1803
00:57:48,960 --> 00:57:51,109
end up with a lemon -- i.e., get sick.

1804
00:57:51,119 --> 00:57:52,950
If the penalty function of getting a

1805
00:57:52,960 --> 00:57:54,150
lemon is large enough,

1806
00:57:54,160 --> 00:57:55,750
and the probability of it is large

1807
00:57:55,760 --> 00:57:57,190
enough, then the rational thing to do

1808
00:57:57,200 --> 00:57:59,430
is to withdraw from that marketplace and

1809
00:57:59,440 --> 00:58:01,349
decide to do DEF CON in "safe mode,"

1810
00:58:01,359 --> 00:58:03,573
and that's exactly what we've done this year.

1811
00:58:04,292 --> 00:58:05,670
Let's apply this to the marketplace

1812
00:58:05,680 --> 00:58:06,851
for transparent coins,

1813
00:58:06,852 --> 00:58:09,430
or surveillance coins, as I like to call them.

1814
00:58:09,440 --> 00:58:11,190
The complete history of every coin is

1815
00:58:11,200 --> 00:58:13,030
traceable going back.  That means,

1816
00:58:13,040 --> 00:58:15,030
if you are a squeaky clean person with a

1817
00:58:15,040 --> 00:58:16,150
good reputation,

1818
00:58:16,160 --> 00:58:17,531
you are a peach seller.

1819
00:58:17,734 --> 00:58:20,470
Your social status is healthy.

1820
00:58:20,480 --> 00:58:22,069
The thing is, if you deal with bitcoin

1821
00:58:22,079 --> 00:58:23,510
with other people, are you going to

1822
00:58:23,520 --> 00:58:24,950
unknowingly, by mistake,

1823
00:58:24,960 --> 00:58:26,950
do a transaction with somebody who is

1824
00:58:26,960 --> 00:58:29,707
not healthy, in terms of a legal status?

1825
00:58:29,708 --> 00:58:31,057
You don't know that.

1826
00:58:31,058 --> 00:58:32,309
You could suffer

1827
00:58:32,319 --> 00:58:34,470
a "lemon consequence," just by dealing with

1828
00:58:34,480 --> 00:58:36,390
other people in this network, because

1829
00:58:36,400 --> 00:58:37,910
this network has this

1830
00:58:37,920 --> 00:58:39,278
undesirable feature that the

1831
00:58:39,279 --> 00:58:40,723
coins are not fungible.

1832
00:58:40,724 --> 00:58:41,919
So what is a squeaky clean

1833
00:58:41,920 --> 00:58:43,030
person going to do?

1834
00:58:43,040 --> 00:58:46,078
They're going to tend to want to go to a coin

1835
00:58:46,079 --> 00:58:47,805
that does not put them in jeopardy

1836
00:58:47,806 --> 00:58:49,990
due to the actions that they can't control

1837
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:51,531
of other people on the network.

1838
00:58:51,532 --> 00:58:52,233
So you're going to see

1839
00:58:52,234 --> 00:58:53,190
the squeaky clean people

1840
00:58:53,200 --> 00:58:54,549
going to something like Monero.

1841
00:58:54,559 --> 00:58:56,789
Which is counterintuitive, certainly,

1842
00:58:56,799 --> 00:58:57,990
according to the

1843
00:58:58,000 --> 00:59:00,069
biased and misleading portrayal that

1844
00:59:00,079 --> 00:59:01,829
often gets put on Monero.

1845
00:59:01,839 --> 00:59:02,939
It's the squeaky clean people

1846
00:59:02,940 --> 00:59:05,526
who need Monero the most.

1847
00:59:06,319 --> 00:59:08,361
So Monero is what Bitcoin noobs think they bought --

1848
00:59:08,362 --> 00:59:11,956
it's sound money, in safe mode.

1849
00:59:13,119 --> 00:59:15,349
I started this talk talking about the

1850
00:59:15,359 --> 00:59:16,150
out of control

1851
00:59:16,160 --> 00:59:18,069
fiat money supply around the world that

1852
00:59:18,079 --> 00:59:19,349
is currently happening as a result of

1853
00:59:19,359 --> 00:59:20,309
the pandemic,

1854
00:59:20,319 --> 00:59:21,694
and that led to the

1855
00:59:21,695 --> 00:59:23,439
idea that one should maybe

1856
00:59:23,440 --> 00:59:25,349
spend some time looking into alternate

1857
00:59:25,359 --> 00:59:26,630
forms of scarcity that are not

1858
00:59:26,640 --> 00:59:27,990
controlled by governments -- that would be

1859
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:29,414
precious metals and also,

1860
00:59:29,415 --> 00:59:31,289
now that there's Nakamoto consensus,

1861
00:59:31,290 --> 00:59:33,328
Bitcoin and Monero.

1862
00:59:33,920 --> 00:59:36,390
How does one process the relative

1863
00:59:36,400 --> 00:59:37,720
expensiveness or cheapness

1864
00:59:37,721 --> 00:59:39,657
of these assets?

1865
00:59:40,160 --> 00:59:42,390
Here is, I think, the only price chart

1866
00:59:42,400 --> 00:59:43,872
that should be looked at

1867
00:59:43,873 --> 00:59:45,270
by anyone who's looking to

1868
00:59:45,280 --> 00:59:47,270
think of cryptocurrency as an investment.

1869
00:59:47,289 --> 00:59:49,006
I'm doing a long-term time scale --

1870
00:59:49,007 --> 00:59:51,510
so this is from 2009 to the present,

1871
00:59:51,520 --> 00:59:53,030
and what I'm doing here is I'm showing

1872
00:59:53,040 --> 00:59:55,109
the value of all the world's bitcoin

1873
00:59:55,119 --> 00:59:56,870
and I'm dividing that by the value of

1874
00:59:56,880 --> 00:59:58,549
all the world's above-ground gold.

1875
00:59:58,559 --> 01:00:00,029
So there are several variables

1876
01:00:00,030 --> 01:00:01,099
that go into this chart:

1877
01:00:01,109 --> 01:00:02,514
first, there's the number of bitcoin

1878
01:00:02,515 --> 01:00:04,069
in existence at any given time;

1879
01:00:04,079 --> 01:00:05,750
there's the price of bitcoin; there's

1880
01:00:05,760 --> 01:00:07,589
the amount of gold in existence at any

1881
01:00:07,599 --> 01:00:09,349
given time; and there's the price of gold.

1882
01:00:09,359 --> 01:00:10,710
You need all four of those ingredients

1883
01:00:10,720 --> 01:00:12,069
to come up with this ratio chart, which

1884
01:00:12,079 --> 01:00:14,150
I'm showing on log scale, again.  And then

1885
01:00:14,160 --> 01:00:15,589
I've done that again for the value of

1886
01:00:15,599 --> 01:00:17,030
all the world's Monero divided by the

1887
01:00:17,040 --> 01:00:18,470
value of all the world's gold.

1888
01:00:18,480 --> 01:00:19,990
Currently all the world's bitcoin is

1889
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:21,829
worth something like two percent that of

1890
01:00:21,839 --> 01:00:22,950
all the world's gold.

1891
01:00:22,960 --> 01:00:25,190
And all the Monero in the world is worth

1892
01:00:25,200 --> 01:00:27,270
about 1/100th of one percent

1893
01:00:27,280 --> 01:00:28,789
of all the world's gold.

1894
01:00:28,799 --> 01:00:30,309
You might be aware that there's been a

1895
01:00:30,319 --> 01:00:31,589
recent spike of interest in

1896
01:00:31,599 --> 01:00:32,710
cryptocurrency prices --

1897
01:00:32,720 --> 01:00:34,849
bitcoin is back over ten thousand dollars --

1898
01:00:34,850 --> 01:00:36,069
but you don't see that here

1899
01:00:36,079 --> 01:00:38,150
because there's also been a spike in the

1900
01:00:38,160 --> 01:00:40,470
price of gold.  The relative valuation of

1901
01:00:40,480 --> 01:00:41,990
crypto to gold has been flat

1902
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:44,390
in the post-pandemic time period.  Is this

1903
01:00:44,400 --> 01:00:46,710
rational that crypto to gold cap ratios

1904
01:00:46,720 --> 01:00:48,446
have been flat during the pandemic?

1905
01:00:48,447 --> 01:00:50,141
I'll leave that to you to decide.

1906
01:00:50,142 --> 01:00:52,390
Second, of these two cryptocurrencies,

1907
01:00:52,400 --> 01:00:54,219
there is one that actually acts like gold,

1908
01:00:54,220 --> 01:00:55,349
because it's fungible.

1909
01:00:55,359 --> 01:00:57,589
Gold does not have on the back of every

1910
01:00:57,599 --> 01:00:59,589
gold bar, a list of everyone who owned

1911
01:00:59,599 --> 01:01:01,270
that gold before you did.

1912
01:01:01,280 --> 01:01:03,349
So it's actually a more apt comparison

1913
01:01:03,359 --> 01:01:05,759
to compare the value of Monero versus gold.

1914
01:01:05,760 --> 01:01:07,377
So is it rational that

1915
01:01:07,378 --> 01:01:09,190
the valuation of Monero is one

1916
01:01:09,200 --> 01:01:10,710
ten-thousandth of that of gold, whereas

1917
01:01:10,720 --> 01:01:12,710
the valuation of bitcoin is one fiftieth

1918
01:01:12,720 --> 01:01:14,549
of that of gold?

1919
01:01:14,559 --> 01:01:16,390
One thing I also wanted to show was a

1920
01:01:16,400 --> 01:01:18,630
chart that counters this very stale

1921
01:01:18,640 --> 01:01:19,910
narrative that there's infinite

1922
01:01:19,920 --> 01:01:21,670
inflation in Monero.

1923
01:01:21,680 --> 01:01:23,670
Let's say you have an investor who

1924
01:01:23,680 --> 01:01:25,109
decides that they want to buy

1925
01:01:25,119 --> 01:01:27,349
one one-millionth of one of these

1926
01:01:27,359 --> 01:01:29,990
alternative forms of scarcity.

1927
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:32,069
To protect themselves against inflation,

1928
01:01:32,079 --> 01:01:33,589
they are not going to buy one

1929
01:01:33,599 --> 01:01:35,716
one-millionth of today's supply;

1930
01:01:35,717 --> 01:01:37,550
they are going to buy one one-millionth

1931
01:01:37,551 --> 01:01:40,479
of the supply in 100 years' time.

1932
01:01:40,480 --> 01:01:42,309
So they're going to look at:  "what is the

1933
01:01:42,319 --> 01:01:44,870
supply of this scarce asset going to be

1934
01:01:44,880 --> 01:01:47,990
in the year 2120 -- and I would like to buy

1935
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:50,230
one one-millionth of that, today."

1936
01:01:50,240 --> 01:01:51,910
First, let's look at gold.  So currently,

1937
01:01:51,920 --> 01:01:53,654
there are about 200,000 metric tons of

1938
01:01:53,655 --> 01:01:55,029
above-ground gold,

1939
01:01:55,039 --> 01:01:56,857
and gold has been expanding

1940
01:01:56,858 --> 01:01:59,200
at about 1.8 percent per year.

1941
01:01:59,201 --> 01:02:00,789
When you compound that over

1942
01:02:00,799 --> 01:02:02,069
a hundred years, that ends up being pretty

1943
01:02:02,079 --> 01:02:04,309
significant.  So in 2120, at that rate,

1944
01:02:04,319 --> 01:02:05,190
there's going to be over a million

1945
01:02:05,200 --> 01:02:06,390
metric tons of gold --

1946
01:02:06,400 --> 01:02:08,470
which means to buy one one-millionth of

1947
01:02:08,480 --> 01:02:09,589
all the gold in the world, you're going

1948
01:02:09,599 --> 01:02:11,270
to end up buying more than a metric ton

1949
01:02:11,280 --> 01:02:12,789
of it -- which, at the current price, is

1950
01:02:12,799 --> 01:02:15,118
going to be $76 million worth of gold.

1951
01:02:15,119 --> 01:02:17,750
That buys you one one-millionth of the

1952
01:02:17,760 --> 01:02:20,549
projected gold supply in the year 2120.

1953
01:02:20,559 --> 01:02:21,990
So let's do that with Bitcoin.  So with

1954
01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:23,829
Bitcoin, they're going to be very proud

1955
01:02:23,839 --> 01:02:25,589
that a hundred years from today, there's

1956
01:02:25,599 --> 01:02:27,510
going to be only 21 million bitcoin

1957
01:02:27,520 --> 01:02:29,910
in existence.  To buy one one-millionth,

1958
01:02:29,920 --> 01:02:30,935
how much does it cost?

1959
01:02:30,936 --> 01:02:32,936
244 thousand dollars.

1960
01:02:33,196 --> 01:02:34,239
How about in Monero?

1961
01:02:34,240 --> 01:02:35,910
Now we have the tail emission, so that

1962
01:02:35,920 --> 01:02:37,510
commonly gets thrown about as being

1963
01:02:37,520 --> 01:02:39,190
"infinite inflation."  Well, actually,

1964
01:02:39,200 --> 01:02:40,230
we know what it's going to be.

1965
01:02:40,240 --> 01:02:41,622
And in a hundred years from now,

1966
01:02:41,623 --> 01:02:43,670
the coin supply will be less than double

1967
01:02:43,680 --> 01:02:44,703
what it is today.

1968
01:02:44,704 --> 01:02:46,870
That's not too bad for a century.

1969
01:02:46,880 --> 01:02:48,789
So to buy one one-millionth of all the

1970
01:02:48,799 --> 01:02:50,710
Monero that will be in the world in the

1971
01:02:50,720 --> 01:02:54,680
year 2120?  Three thousand dollars.

1972
01:02:58,160 --> 01:03:00,150
If you want to learn more about Monero --

1973
01:03:00,160 --> 01:03:02,230
there's monerovillage.org for the

1974
01:03:02,240 --> 01:03:04,549
rest of the festivities happening this week.

1975
01:03:04,550 --> 01:03:06,080
Also, the official website

1976
01:03:06,081 --> 01:03:07,464
is getmonero.org --

1977
01:03:07,465 --> 01:03:08,526
that's important to know, it's

1978
01:03:08,527 --> 01:03:09,919
"get monero dot org" --

1979
01:03:09,920 --> 01:03:11,308
not other variants.

1980
01:03:11,309 --> 01:03:12,499
If you want to get in touch with me over

1981
01:03:12,500 --> 01:03:14,558
email, it's Daniel at Sweetwater Consulting.

1982
01:03:14,559 --> 01:03:15,968
Thanks for your attention.
