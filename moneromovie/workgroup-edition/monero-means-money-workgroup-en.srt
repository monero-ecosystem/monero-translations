00:01:19,060 --> 00:01:21,900
[Part 1:  Scarcity]  NATIONAL GEOGRAPHIC SOCIETY - "GOLD!" (1978):  Once upon a time, the dollar was as good as gold.

2
00:01:21,900 --> 00:01:25,720
The United States and most other countries minted gold coins.

3
00:01:25,720 --> 00:01:28,360
Paper money was a promise to pay in gold.

4
00:01:28,360 --> 00:01:31,560
But today, the dollar and most other world currencies

5
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:34,840
are supported not by gold, but by credit --

6
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:38,040
paper backed by paper.

7
00:01:42,500 --> 00:01:45,300
The experience of Germany in the early 1920s

8
00:01:45,300 --> 00:01:46,880
is the classic horror story

9
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:50,000
told by those who urge a return to the gold standard

10
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,700
as the best way to stop inflation and stabilize economies.

11
00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:57,320
As prices rose, the government printed more and more currency

12
00:01:57,320 --> 00:01:59,720
and prices soared again.

13
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:02,340
Eventually, the German Mark literally was not worth

14
00:02:02,340 --> 00:02:04,420
the paper it was printed on.

15
00:02:04,420 --> 00:02:07,340
Bundles of paper money were needed to buy a loaf of bread,

16
00:02:07,340 --> 00:02:11,180
and a postage stamp cost millions.

17
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:19,080
DR. DANIEL KIM (December 27, 2019):  
What is the situation for scarcity?
Why do we even need cryptocurrency?

18
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:23,400
Let's look at the everyday money that we use.

19
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:25,160
There's the US dollar,

20
00:02:25,940 --> 00:02:27,240
the Chinese yuan,

21
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:29,240
the Euro and the Swiss franc.

22
00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:31,540
And what I'm showing here is

23
00:02:31,780 --> 00:02:34,400
official government statistics as to

24
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:37,340
the amount of money in circulation.

25
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:39,960
This is M1, which is

26
00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:41,640
paper money, currency

27
00:02:41,660 --> 00:02:44,640
and also checking accounts and savings accounts.

28
00:02:44,820 --> 00:02:47,960
It's cash and things that act like cash,

29
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:49,160
all together,

30
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:51,560
and each of these plots is showing

31
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:55,660
since October 2008, which is when the Bitcoin white paper came out.

32
00:02:55,820 --> 00:02:59,280
That is the left-hand scale of each of these four plots.

33
00:02:59,660 --> 00:03:04,980
This [left] is 2008 and then this [right] is the end of 2019.

34
00:03:05,740 --> 00:03:09,420
You can see that the money supply has inflated

35
00:03:09,580 --> 00:03:10,760
for everybody.

36
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:13,220
In just 11 years,

37
00:03:13,300 --> 00:03:18,160
the money supply of the US dollar has gone up 2.6 times.

38
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:20,260
In other words,

39
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:24,620
the printing presses of money have been going on at that rate.

40
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:26,920
We don't really notice it because

41
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:30,080
every year the prices that we see go up a little bit

42
00:03:30,140 --> 00:03:33,540
but it's like the frog in boiling water, right?

43
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:35,740
The frog doesn't understand that

44
00:03:35,740 --> 00:03:37,820
it's sitting in boiling water until it's too late

45
00:03:37,820 --> 00:03:39,260
and it's cooked.

46
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:40,880
That's the kind of

47
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,480
situation that we find ourselves in.

48
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:45,940
The thing is that

49
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:49,600
all of the global Fiat currencies are

50
00:03:49,660 --> 00:03:53,180
turning on the printing presses at a disturbing rate.

51
00:03:53,260 --> 00:03:54,840
But what counts as victory?

52
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:58,160
What counts as being sound and

53
00:03:58,220 --> 00:04:01,920
prudent with your particular country's currency?

54
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:06,360
Well, it's inflating slightly less fast than the other guys, right?

55
00:04:07,060 --> 00:04:08,580
We still have this situation where

56
00:04:08,580 --> 00:04:10,580
if you zoom out,

57
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:12,660
for example, for the US dollar,

58
00:04:12,740 --> 00:04:15,040
if you go to a 50-year time scale

59
00:04:15,140 --> 00:04:18,440
you see basically an exponential growth curve.

60
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:23,040
This is a problem that all savers face --

61
00:04:23,060 --> 00:04:25,220
anyone who has assets to save

62
00:04:25,300 --> 00:04:28,760
is up against this current that's coming up against them,

63
00:04:28,820 --> 00:04:30,940
in that they're constantly being diluted

64
00:04:31,020 --> 00:04:34,180
by new money that's being created.

65
00:04:35,980 --> 00:04:38,900
2008 is when the Nakamoto white paper came out.

66
00:04:39,180 --> 00:04:40,860
This is the Bitcoin white paper,

67
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:43,880
and the key insight to this --

68
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:45,640
I won't go too much into the

69
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:47,660
geeky details, although

70
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:51,420
I'm assuming that everyone here has an IQ of at least 140,

71
00:04:51,980 --> 00:04:53,120
so it wouldn't take you long

72
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:54,880
if you haven't already

73
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:57,060
to look at this paper and study it --

74
00:04:57,060 --> 00:04:59,240
but I would say that

75
00:04:59,620 --> 00:05:03,980
the Nobel Prize in Economics cannot be given to an anonymous person.

76
00:05:04,100 --> 00:05:07,040
But were Satoshi Nakamoto a real [identified] person

77
00:05:07,140 --> 00:05:08,980
this clearly would be a

78
00:05:09,020 --> 00:05:12,360
Nobel prize-winning insight in economics,

79
00:05:12,420 --> 00:05:13,800
in which

80
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:17,300
economics is just the study of scarcity, really.

81
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:19,540
What Nakamoto consensus does

82
00:05:19,580 --> 00:05:22,800
is it synthesizes a method

83
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:25,300
to create digital scarcity

84
00:05:25,380 --> 00:05:27,880
without needing a central authority

85
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:30,340
to maintain that scarcity.

86
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:33,680
In all of our national monies --

87
00:05:33,900 --> 00:05:36,740
in the European Central Bank,

88
00:05:36,820 --> 00:05:38,920
the Federal Reserve in America --

89
00:05:38,940 --> 00:05:42,140
these are all centrally governed bodies

90
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:44,740
that decide what to do with the money supply.

91
00:05:44,740 --> 00:05:45,340
Now

92
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:47,580
the macroeconomic theory is that

93
00:05:47,620 --> 00:05:50,440
the money supply will expand and contract

94
00:05:50,460 --> 00:05:55,660
to match the actual economic output of the society.

95
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:59,840
So in other words, if a society is really productive and it makes a lot of stuff,

96
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:05,060
then the society is justified in inflating the money supply, because they've been productive.

97
00:06:05,640 --> 00:06:07,380
But the problem is that

98
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:09,720
countries get into trouble.

99
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:11,180
They get into debt.

100
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:14,100
They promise services to people

101
00:06:14,140 --> 00:06:16,600
that are too expensive and then they can't pay for them,

102
00:06:16,620 --> 00:06:17,920
they go into debt.

103
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:19,720
The problem is that

104
00:06:19,820 --> 00:06:24,280
mismanagement causes this kind of fragile balance

105
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:27,720
between the size of the money supply and the size of the underlying economy,

106
00:06:27,780 --> 00:06:29,960
to get out of whack [balance].

107
00:06:31,180 --> 00:06:33,720
So why is it interesting to have

108
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:36,160
a source of scarcity that doesn't require

109
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:40,320
a central committee to be making decisions

110
00:06:41,020 --> 00:06:42,400
for that money?

111
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:44,460
It's that it offers

112
00:06:44,540 --> 00:06:48,040
a way for people to opt out

113
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:50,960
of the Fiat monetary system.

114
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:52,940
It also provides a

115
00:06:52,940 --> 00:06:55,020
kind of fire under the feet of the

116
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:59,380
Fiat central banks to maybe do a little bit of a better job.

117
00:07:00,620 --> 00:07:01,940
Maybe we

118
00:07:01,940 --> 00:07:03,620
might have

119
00:07:03,700 --> 00:07:05,580
fewer financial crises in the future --

120
00:07:05,580 --> 00:07:07,180
maybe we won't have another

121
00:07:07,640 --> 00:07:12,220
2009 style financial crisis.

122
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:16,380
So, the way that the Nakamoto consensus does this --

123
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:17,640
there are three ways.

124
00:07:17,640 --> 00:07:20,020
At the account level,

125
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:20,920
in other words,

126
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:24,200
how is it that one person's Bitcoin is not

127
00:07:24,520 --> 00:07:26,780
confused with another person's Bitcoin?

128
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:27,860
It's that

129
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:32,200
when a person "signs up for a Bitcoin account," so to speak,

130
00:07:32,260 --> 00:07:35,120
what they're really doing is picking a number.

131
00:07:35,180 --> 00:07:37,800
They're just picking a number out of a

132
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:40,580
256-bit field.

133
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:43,520
People are really bad at

134
00:07:43,540 --> 00:07:45,440
imagining huge numbers,

135
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:50,360
but we're talking about picking a number between zero and 10 to the 77th.

136
00:07:51,300 --> 00:07:53,440
One with 77 zeroes after that.

137
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:56,180
To understand how big that is,

138
00:07:56,500 --> 00:07:59,940
imagine the diameter of the Milky Way galaxy.

139
00:08:00,020 --> 00:08:01,940
Now imagine electrons

140
00:08:01,940 --> 00:08:03,540
being lined up

141
00:08:03,640 --> 00:08:04,620
right next to each other --

142
00:08:04,660 --> 00:08:08,780
and I'm using just the classical electron radius here.

143
00:08:10,140 --> 00:08:14,580
For the entire diameter of the Milky Way we have electrons lined up.

144
00:08:14,820 --> 00:08:16,720
That turns out to not be enough.

145
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:18,720
You have to take one of these electrons

146
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:22,240
and blow that up to the size of the Milky Way galaxy

147
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:26,440
and then get another set of electrons going across.

148
00:08:26,740 --> 00:08:27,960
Then even that's not enough,

149
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:29,460
you have to take one of those electrons,

150
00:08:29,460 --> 00:08:31,460
blow it up to the size of this hall

151
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:34,800
and then you have bacteria lined up one after each other.

152
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:36,540
That's 10 to the 77th.

153
00:08:36,540 --> 00:08:41,780
That's how vast the space is of the random number that you're choosing

154
00:08:41,780 --> 00:08:46,020
and that is why getting a Bitcoin account doesn't require

155
00:08:46,060 --> 00:08:49,540
going to fill out some form and asking permission for an account --

156
00:08:49,540 --> 00:08:51,540
you just pick a number.

157
00:08:51,540 --> 00:08:52,700
You just pick a number,

158
00:08:52,700 --> 00:08:55,620
that's your private key and you need to

159
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:56,740
defend that

160
00:08:56,740 --> 00:08:58,460
because knowledge of that private key

161
00:08:58,460 --> 00:09:02,760
is what is needed to spend a person's Bitcoin.

162
00:09:03,020 --> 00:09:04,880
Aggregate level scarcity -- that is,

163
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:09,180
how do we know how much of the Bitcoin there is in the entire monetary system,

164
00:09:09,180 --> 00:09:12,240
and how do we know that's not going to get corrupted?

165
00:09:12,380 --> 00:09:14,180
Well, the scarcity is

166
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:17,720
enforced by an open network of miners

167
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:19,940
which are really gossipy accountants

168
00:09:20,460 --> 00:09:26,440
and they are rewarded for behaving consistently with the consensus rule set.

169
00:09:26,740 --> 00:09:30,140
Finally, how do we know that the record of

170
00:09:30,140 --> 00:09:31,620
who sent what to who

171
00:09:31,620 --> 00:09:33,600
which is, what the blockchain records --

172
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:36,660
so the blockchain is a series of blocks;

173
00:09:36,660 --> 00:09:39,880
each block contains transactions,

174
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:42,140
this person sent money to this person,

175
00:09:42,140 --> 00:09:44,560
who sent what to whom and how much

176
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:48,200
and each block is just a record of that --

177
00:09:48,260 --> 00:09:51,080
how do we know that that's not going to get corrupted over time?

178
00:09:51,100 --> 00:09:53,620
Because, as we all know, there's bit rot.

179
00:09:53,620 --> 00:09:55,780
There can be corruption,

180
00:09:55,780 --> 00:09:58,580
there could be some

181
00:10:02,020 --> 00:10:04,800
malfeasance going on with the state of the database.

182
00:10:05,300 --> 00:10:08,120
The database is maintained because each block

183
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:11,720
has a small data field in it that the miner can change

184
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:13,200
that's called the nonce.

185
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:15,200
And each miner

186
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:21,200
randomly changes the nonce so that the hash of the block is lower than a number,

187
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:22,420
called the difficulty.

188
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:25,480
Usually when we talk about hash functions

189
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:28,680
we don't care about the actual value of the hash function.

190
00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:31,820
We just care that the hash matches some other hash.

191
00:10:31,820 --> 00:10:34,200
Like if you're checking for file integrity,

192
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:37,360
then you would take the hash of the file that you downloaded

193
00:10:37,460 --> 00:10:40,080
and compare that with the hash of the file that you're looking for

194
00:10:40,140 --> 00:10:41,820
and you compare those.

195
00:10:41,820 --> 00:10:45,160
In this case, we're actually caring about the number of the hash.

196
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:47,320
How small, how large is that number --

197
00:10:47,380 --> 00:10:53,080
and the difficulty is a number that must be

198
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:54,800
satisfied by each block.

199
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:55,380
In other words,

200
00:10:55,380 --> 00:10:58,520
the hash of each block needs to be lower than the difficulty.

201
00:11:00,260 --> 00:11:02,460
So, to make a real world analogy of this,

202
00:11:02,460 --> 00:11:05,100
imagine that you have an accounting book

203
00:11:05,100 --> 00:11:10,600
and each page of the accounting book has 10 minutes worth of transactions on it.

204
00:11:10,700 --> 00:11:12,920
And you want to make a way to make sure that

205
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:16,380
each page is really rare in some way.

206
00:11:16,700 --> 00:11:19,080
One way you could do this is you could say:

207
00:11:19,180 --> 00:11:26,800
the mass of every page of this accounting book has to be an even multiple of 1 million atoms.

208
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:30,240
So, each accountant is going to be

209
00:11:30,280 --> 00:11:31,920
touching the paper,

210
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:34,020
rubbing it, erasing little bits

211
00:11:34,100 --> 00:11:38,000
because at that level you're taking away or adding

212
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:39,700
trillions and trillions of atoms

213
00:11:39,700 --> 00:11:42,140
so it's going to be a random number whether

214
00:11:44,300 --> 00:11:49,340
your page is actually a exact multiple of a million atoms.

215
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:52,500
So once that's found,

216
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:54,480
that's a very rare page.

217
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:56,860
It's a rare page because it has an

218
00:11:56,860 --> 00:11:59,820
exact multiple of 1 million atoms to it,

219
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:02,500
and because it's now a digital representation,

220
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:04,540
you can copy that exactly.

221
00:12:04,660 --> 00:12:07,300
Now you have a chain of blocks,

222
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:11,200
each one of these has this rare attribute

223
00:12:11,520 --> 00:12:15,760
and the blockchain links them all together.

224
00:12:17,740 --> 00:12:19,680
Scarcity in Bitcoin and Monero:

225
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:21,680
they both have an original code base.

226
00:12:22,140 --> 00:12:24,640
There are many, many projects in cryptocurrency in which

227
00:12:24,640 --> 00:12:27,540
Bitcoin was simply forked and modified a little bit --

228
00:12:27,540 --> 00:12:28,800
that's not the case in Monero.

229
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:31,060
It was written from scratch.

230
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:33,380
The elliptic curves used are different;

231
00:12:33,660 --> 00:12:35,800
this is a form of technical hedging.

232
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:39,600
In Bitcoin the secp256k1 elliptical curve is used

233
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:42,860
whereas in Monero it's ed25519.

234
00:12:43,160 --> 00:12:48,140
Both Bitcoin and Monero, as I mentioned before, require a private key.

235
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:52,720
Spending the cryptocurrency requires that you know a number

236
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:54,160
and that's the private key.

237
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:56,620
That's true in both Bitcoin and Monero.

238
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:59,420
Where we start to differ is that

239
00:12:59,500 --> 00:13:02,060
Monero also has what's called a view key.

240
00:13:02,060 --> 00:13:04,340
The view key is another private key

241
00:13:04,340 --> 00:13:08,500
which is actually kind of a subset of the spend key.

242
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:11,640
The view key is what is needed to decrypt

243
00:13:11,640 --> 00:13:16,600
the transactions on the blockchain that you personally are involved with.

244
00:13:17,560 --> 00:13:18,740
So, if you have the view key

245
00:13:18,740 --> 00:13:22,440
you can see what transactions you were involved in on the blockchain.

246
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:25,160
Everything else remains encrypted.

247
00:13:26,220 --> 00:13:27,900
The address space is different --

248
00:13:27,900 --> 00:13:32,300
in Bitcoin it's 10 to the 60th, in Monero it's 10 to the 76th.

249
00:13:32,300 --> 00:13:36,080
There are more addresses available in Monero,

250
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:38,740
which means if you're worried about the birthday problem --

251
00:13:38,740 --> 00:13:41,140
the birthday problem is the problem in which

252
00:13:41,140 --> 00:13:43,140
if you have a group of 30 people,

253
00:13:43,140 --> 00:13:48,800
chances are much higher than you would expect that 2 people out of those 30 have the same birthday --

254
00:13:49,140 --> 00:13:53,380
so if you extend this now to the problem of picking a random number

255
00:13:53,380 --> 00:13:55,400
and calling it your own for

256
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:59,840
a cryptocurrency account, you have the same problem.

257
00:14:00,100 --> 00:14:01,520
There's no guarantee that

258
00:14:01,520 --> 00:14:04,700
the random number that you picked for your cryptocurrency account

259
00:14:04,700 --> 00:14:07,860
is not going to subsequently be picked by me.

260
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:09,660
That's the birthday problem, and

261
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:15,080
the birthday problem is less of a concern the more addresses there are.

262
00:14:16,140 --> 00:14:19,720
The emission deceleration is another difference between Bitcoin and Monero.

263
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:21,400
In Bitcoin it's stepwise --

264
00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:23,680
you might have heard of this thing called "the halvening."

265
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:26,600
This is: every 4 years, in Bitcoin,

266
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:29,900
the number of Bitcoins that gets rewarded to miners

267
00:14:29,900 --> 00:14:34,720
as a reward for finding a page in the blockchain gets cut in half.

268
00:14:34,780 --> 00:14:37,000
Which means that on every miner's calendar

269
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,260
there's a date circled in red that

270
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:41,700
their income is going to get cut in half.

271
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:44,360
And that introduces a bunch of

272
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:47,760
needless drama, really, in mining.

273
00:14:47,860 --> 00:14:53,760
In Monero, we avoid this by having a continuously decreasing emission.

274
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:56,600
Now another difference is in

275
00:14:56,600 --> 00:15:00,140
what is the emission rate of coins in the far future.

276
00:15:00,340 --> 00:15:04,340
In Bitcoin, the block reward eventually goes to zero

277
00:15:04,340 --> 00:15:10,600
and they anticipate using transaction fees to make up the difference.

278
00:15:10,620 --> 00:15:15,700
In Monero, we have a concern that we want to always be assured that

279
00:15:15,700 --> 00:15:20,060
miners will have incentive to keep working for the system.

280
00:15:20,060 --> 00:15:22,760
And so in Monero we have what's called the tail emission

281
00:15:22,760 --> 00:15:25,860
which works out to be 0.6 Monero per block

282
00:15:25,860 --> 00:15:27,700
that goes on in perpetuity.

283
00:15:27,700 --> 00:15:32,500
But that future money basically gets used to pay miners

284
00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:35,840
to continue to provide security for the network.

285
00:15:36,640 --> 00:15:39,600
What's the far future inflation rate, then?

286
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:43,020
In Bitcoin, they can say it's exactly zero.

287
00:15:43,020 --> 00:15:47,960
In Bitcoin they're fond of saying there's only ever going to be 21 million Bitcoins created

288
00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:50,700
and that's an easy thing for people to understand.

289
00:15:51,160 --> 00:15:55,300
In Monero, we have constant linear inflation --

290
00:15:55,780 --> 00:15:59,880
but it's not really correct to say that this is "infinite supply" as

291
00:15:59,880 --> 00:16:02,400
gets bandied about.

292
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:05,420
Because if you look at the inflation rate -- in Monero,

293
00:16:05,420 --> 00:16:08,240
it asymptotically goes to zero.

294
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:10,920
If you look at any macroeconomic theory,

295
00:16:11,260 --> 00:16:13,820
what the relevant variable is

296
00:16:13,820 --> 00:16:15,740
is the inflation rate.

297
00:16:15,820 --> 00:16:17,460
Nobody really cares that

298
00:16:17,460 --> 00:16:22,560
the nominal amount of US dollars is going up by whatever trillions of dollars per year --

299
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:24,560
it's the percentage that matters.

300
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:27,220
In Monero that percentage is already low and

301
00:16:27,220 --> 00:16:29,460
it'll continue getting lower.

302
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:32,140
Some curves to show what I'm talking about --

303
00:16:32,140 --> 00:16:34,180
these are supply emission curves showing

304
00:16:34,180 --> 00:16:39,460
how many coins of each type exist as a function of time.

305
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:43,720
You can see that Monero had a later start here [2014]

306
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:45,620
and it has a tail emission.

307
00:16:45,620 --> 00:16:48,960
This tail emission is this constant linear slope [starting 2022].

308
00:16:49,720 --> 00:16:51,620
The reason for this slope, again, is that

309
00:16:51,620 --> 00:16:57,380
the new coins that get emitted are being rewarded to miners who help secure the network.

310
00:16:57,440 --> 00:17:02,220
Whereas in Bitcoin, they have an impending problem to deal with

311
00:17:02,220 --> 00:17:05,500
in that their coin emission is coming up to this 21 million mark --

312
00:17:05,500 --> 00:17:07,220
it [the emission] is going to go basically to zero.

313
00:17:07,220 --> 00:17:11,240
There are some papers out there that have

314
00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:16,320
proposed that the security of the network might be in jeopardy at that point.

315
00:17:16,420 --> 00:17:19,100
What if we take the first derivative of this curve --

316
00:17:19,100 --> 00:17:24,580
so, we look at how much more supply is there in this year versus last year,

317
00:17:24,580 --> 00:17:26,380
in other words, what's the inflation rate?

318
00:17:26,380 --> 00:17:28,700
Here's what you see.

319
00:17:30,120 --> 00:17:32,060
I'm comparing several different assets here.

320
00:17:32,060 --> 00:17:34,060
This [lower left] is the inflation rate of gold.

321
00:17:34,060 --> 00:17:36,620
We usually don't think of gold is inflating

322
00:17:36,620 --> 00:17:38,440
but of course there are miners --

323
00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:41,700
there are actual physical miners digging in the ground and

324
00:17:42,020 --> 00:17:46,940
coming up with gold chunks to add to the world's supply of above-ground gold.

325
00:17:47,220 --> 00:17:52,160
That turns out to be about 1.5% per year of inflation in gold.

326
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:54,840
So if you think of gold as being sound money

327
00:17:54,840 --> 00:18:01,500
then that 1.5% inflation rate is going to be sort of a line in the sand.

328
00:18:01,540 --> 00:18:04,300
As you can see, both Bitcoin and Monero

329
00:18:04,300 --> 00:18:07,160
this dotted blue [vertical] line is showing where we are right now.

330
00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:11,280
We're coming to a very interesting point in cryptocurrency history

331
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:13,880
in that, up until now

332
00:18:13,880 --> 00:18:17,360
there's been a lot of emission happening.

333
00:18:17,820 --> 00:18:20,080
In order to get these coins out there

334
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:23,320
the block rewards have been relatively high

335
00:18:23,320 --> 00:18:26,680
but we're now coming up on a new kind of era of scarcity,

336
00:18:26,680 --> 00:18:29,600
if you look at this to the right of here [2019].

337
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:35,400
And in fact, the inflation rate of Monero is going to be lower than that of Bitcoin

338
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:39,380
for the next 6 years, until 2025.

339
00:18:39,380 --> 00:18:42,540
Then there's going to be a 4 year period when they're about the same

340
00:18:42,540 --> 00:18:45,800
and then, starting in 2029, the

341
00:18:45,800 --> 00:18:50,160
inflation rate of Bitcoin will once again go below Monero.

342
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:53,320
But then, again, this comes with a question mark:

343
00:18:53,320 --> 00:18:58,520
how are those miners going to be paid, to be incentivized to support the network --

344
00:18:58,520 --> 00:19:01,920
since that is a crucial feature of Nakamoto consensus,

345
00:19:01,920 --> 00:19:06,580
that game theoretically, all of the miners are incentivized to be honest

346
00:19:06,580 --> 00:19:10,700
and not to try to game the system for their own greed.

347
00:19:12,520 --> 00:19:15,320
All right.  There's a form of unwanted scarcity, and that's mining hardware.

348
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:19,620
And this is something that has been a big issue in Monero.

349
00:19:20,260 --> 00:19:24,240
In the Bitcoin white paper, Nakamoto wrote "one CPU, one vote"

350
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:27,800
and that idea is that the reward that a miner gets

351
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:30,540
should be proportional to their effort.

352
00:19:30,540 --> 00:19:32,880
It should be proportional to the expense

353
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:35,780
that the miner incurred in mining.

354
00:19:37,040 --> 00:19:40,040
In other words, there should ideally be a linear function

355
00:19:40,040 --> 00:19:44,520
between the miner's expense and the miner's reward.

356
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:48,560
Now, unfortunately, economies of scale in silicon manufacturing

357
00:19:48,560 --> 00:19:50,580
have destroyed this linear relationship.

358
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:54,500
So in other words, if you have about 25 million dollars

359
00:19:54,500 --> 00:19:58,360
to spend on a new fabrication facility in Shenzhen,

360
00:19:58,360 --> 00:20:03,980
then you can churn out your own silicon chips that do nothing but

361
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:07,000
do the Bitcoin proof-of-work.

362
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,820
These are ASICS, and

363
00:20:09,820 --> 00:20:13,560
they've been on the network on Bitcoin for several years now,

364
00:20:13,560 --> 00:20:20,180
to the point that at this point, Bitcoin mining is basically a Chinese oligopoly.

365
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:25,520
So this brings up a centralization concern.

366
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:29,020
It's not necessarily a problem that it's China that has all the mining,

367
00:20:29,020 --> 00:20:31,080
it's really more of a problem that

368
00:20:31,080 --> 00:20:33,720
it's one certain area of the world that has

369
00:20:33,720 --> 00:20:38,720
basically control of all of the world's Bitcoin hash power.

370
00:20:39,020 --> 00:20:42,900
There are further news items that are cause for concern,

371
00:20:42,900 --> 00:20:46,640
for example, the growing trade war between China and the West.

372
00:20:47,040 --> 00:20:49,100
There is a press article out that said

373
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:52,060
the Chinese government has recently decreed that

374
00:20:52,060 --> 00:20:57,080
only Chinese computer hardware is to be used in government offices

375
00:20:57,080 --> 00:20:58,740
starting in a year.

376
00:20:58,740 --> 00:21:02,820
There's some deadline by which all of the Dells and the

377
00:21:02,820 --> 00:21:06,820
American companies' computers are to be kicked out.

378
00:21:06,820 --> 00:21:12,200
So something similar could well happen for Chinese-manufactured Bitcoin ASICS.

379
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:16,400
We kind of take for granted that there's a free flow of goods in the world,

380
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:21,800
but what happens if not only does one part of the world control the manufacture

381
00:21:21,800 --> 00:21:23,860
of all of the crypto hash power,

382
00:21:23,860 --> 00:21:28,200
but then is unable to even export it due to a trade war?

383
00:21:29,220 --> 00:21:35,200
In Monero we try to take this decentralization question quite seriously

384
00:21:36,220 --> 00:21:38,820
and we've done some changes to the proof-of-work

385
00:21:38,820 --> 00:21:41,320
to support the little guy who's mining.

386
00:21:41,320 --> 00:21:43,800
That is, when Bitcoin started,

387
00:21:43,800 --> 00:21:47,680
it was possible for just a regular person running

388
00:21:47,680 --> 00:21:51,840
the Bitcoin client on their computer to actually have a shot

389
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:53,900
at getting a mining reward.

390
00:21:53,900 --> 00:21:55,960
Those days are long gone because now

391
00:21:55,960 --> 00:22:01,940
the hash power is dominated by these massive farms of ASICS.

392
00:22:02,120 --> 00:22:06,660
So it's just hopeless for any little guy to try to mine Bitcoin.

393
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:09,880
In Monero, we're trying to change that

394
00:22:09,880 --> 00:22:12,220
and so the proof of work has been modified several times.

395
00:22:12,420 --> 00:22:15,860
And now, as of just last month [November 2019],

396
00:22:15,860 --> 00:22:18,160
the proof of work in Monero is now RandomX

397
00:22:18,160 --> 00:22:22,060
which actually uses every single capability of a CPU

398
00:22:22,060 --> 00:22:23,920
in doing the proof of work.

399
00:22:23,920 --> 00:22:27,600
There's a basically a random program that gets executed.

400
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:32,680
Each core of the processor needs 2 gigabytes of RAM to run well.

401
00:22:33,640 --> 00:22:37,280
This was a design decision made to

402
00:22:37,860 --> 00:22:41,080
make it harder for botnets to control the network,

403
00:22:41,080 --> 00:22:44,460
because if your computer is infected with a botnet

404
00:22:45,820 --> 00:22:49,180
and 14 out of your 16 gigabytes of RAM are being eaten up,

405
00:22:49,180 --> 00:22:51,320
you're probably going to notice it.

406
00:22:51,320 --> 00:22:55,260
So it was a deliberate design decision in RandomX to use a

407
00:22:55,260 --> 00:23:00,940
high required amount of RAM for processing.

408
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:04,020
There's another source of scarcity

409
00:23:04,020 --> 00:23:07,020
that is not necessarily one that you want in a blockchain,

410
00:23:07,020 --> 00:23:09,200
and that is access to layer one.

411
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:13,560
Bitcoin's 1 megabyte block limit caused a project fork.

412
00:23:13,560 --> 00:23:18,500
There was basically a civil war in Bitcoin over whether or not it was okay

413
00:23:19,400 --> 00:23:22,480
to make blocks stay at this 1 megabyte limit.

414
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:25,820
It still rages on to this day. It's still a holy war

415
00:23:25,820 --> 00:23:30,060
and this is something that Monero has avoided thus far.

416
00:23:30,060 --> 00:23:33,460
Its solution to this is to use an adaptive block size

417
00:23:33,460 --> 00:23:38,380
in which the maximum block size of a Monero block is flexible

418
00:23:38,380 --> 00:23:43,540
and it can organically expand or shrink along with demand.

419
00:23:43,540 --> 00:23:46,060
With, of course, provisions in there

420
00:23:46,060 --> 00:23:50,620
to prevent the system from getting gamed.

421
00:23:51,260 --> 00:23:54,500
And there's ongoing research to reduce the transaction size.

422
00:23:54,500 --> 00:23:56,280
There's bulletproofs that went in recently

423
00:23:56,280 --> 00:24:01,040
that reduce transaction sizes by a factor of 10.  That went in,

424
00:24:01,040 --> 00:24:07,580
and overnight the transaction fees for transacting Monero went down by a factor of 10

425
00:24:07,580 --> 00:24:12,460
because the transaction fee is based on the kilobyte size of the transaction.

426
00:24:27,770 --> 00:24:31,280
[Part 2: Fungibility / Privacy]  WARREN STEIBEL - "RIGHT OF PRIVACY" (1968):  This baby is just one second old.

427
00:24:31,490 --> 00:24:32,760
Here in the delivery room

428
00:24:32,760 --> 00:24:35,360
of Mount Sinai Hospital in New York,

429
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:38,080
he has just won his first fight --

430
00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:40,540
the fight to life.

431
00:24:41,100 --> 00:24:44,730
His parents allowed our cameras to film his birth.

432
00:24:44,730 --> 00:24:47,440
His footprints are taken for identification.

433
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:51,630
He is still less than a minute old, and this is his first record.

434
00:24:53,900 --> 00:24:56,820
His file has begun.

435
00:24:57,010 --> 00:24:58,530
When this baby is a young man

436
00:24:58,530 --> 00:25:00,530
celebrating his 17th birthday,

437
00:25:00,530 --> 00:25:04,300
the year will be 1984.

438
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:08,320
Will his 1984 be the world that George Orwell foresaw --

439
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:10,230
a world stripped of privacy,

440
00:25:10,230 --> 00:25:12,820
a world watched by Big Brother?

441
00:25:12,820 --> 00:25:15,150
Or will this child have what Justice Brandeis

442
00:25:15,150 --> 00:25:16,630
at the turn of the century labeled

443
00:25:16,630 --> 00:25:18,780
our inalienable right,

444
00:25:18,780 --> 00:25:20,920
the right to enjoy life,

445
00:25:20,970 --> 00:25:25,130
the right to privacy?

446
00:25:26,420 --> 00:25:28,200
DR. DANIEL KIM (December 27, 2019): 
Bitcoin is transparent.

447
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:33,160
If you are new to crypto you might be under the impression

448
00:25:33,160 --> 00:25:36,360
that if you have Bitcoin, you're anonymous.

449
00:25:36,360 --> 00:25:38,620
It's this "anonymous magic internet money"

450
00:25:38,620 --> 00:25:40,620
that you might have heard about.

451
00:25:40,620 --> 00:25:42,620
Nothing could be further from the truth --

452
00:25:42,620 --> 00:25:47,440
the popular press continues to push this misleading narrative.

453
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:49,420
Bitcoin is completely transparent

454
00:25:49,420 --> 00:25:52,120
and if you read the Bitcoin white paper, it's all there.

455
00:25:52,120 --> 00:25:58,000
It's specified that the sender, the receiver and how much got sent

456
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:03,380
is recorded in plaintext and recorded in the blockchain,

457
00:26:03,380 --> 00:26:07,120
which, because it has all this proof-of-work up behind it --

458
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:10,120
remember what I was saying about each transaction in the block

459
00:26:10,120 --> 00:26:16,060
has a hash that makes it a very rare and unique set of data,

460
00:26:16,340 --> 00:26:20,540
it's the multiple of 1 million atoms thing, right --

461
00:26:20,540 --> 00:26:26,120
so basically, these transparent details are written and etched into that blockchain forever.

462
00:26:26,120 --> 00:26:29,720
There is no escaping that.

463
00:26:29,720 --> 00:26:34,660
It's completely incompatible, for example, with European privacy law, the GDPR,

464
00:26:34,660 --> 00:26:36,680
which has this "right to be forgotten"

465
00:26:36,680 --> 00:26:39,880
that is totally non-existent in Bitcoin --

466
00:26:39,880 --> 00:26:43,600
once a transaction gets put into the Bitcoin blockchain, it's there.

467
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:45,840
It's there forever.

468
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:49,640
And the only thing that is not

469
00:26:49,640 --> 00:26:52,960
totally transparent is that the Bitcoin address

470
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:56,860
is just a hex string -- it's a string,

471
00:26:56,860 --> 00:26:57,640
I mean...

472
00:26:57,640 --> 00:26:59,620
when you come down to it, everything's a hex string --

473
00:26:59,620 --> 00:27:04,920
but the Bitcoin address is a sequence of letters and numbers that looks anonymous.

474
00:27:04,920 --> 00:27:09,400
But once that gets associated to your name and face,

475
00:27:09,400 --> 00:27:11,640
that association, that metadata,

476
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:16,260
that marriage between a Bitcoin account number and your identity,

477
00:27:16,260 --> 00:27:18,260
that doesn't change.

478
00:27:18,540 --> 00:27:21,560
Because the blockchain is etched in stone forever,

479
00:27:21,560 --> 00:27:23,440
and it's constantly growing,

480
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:28,300
the job of the people trying to identify and "dox" everyone

481
00:27:28,300 --> 00:27:30,360
is just a waiting game.

482
00:27:30,360 --> 00:27:32,300
You have this blockchain -- every day,

483
00:27:32,300 --> 00:27:34,300
you get some little piece of information --

484
00:27:34,300 --> 00:27:40,860
"Oh, you know, Joe in Leipzig signed up with (an) exchange".

485
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:44,300
Now their identity information is associated with this.

486
00:27:44,560 --> 00:27:47,120
Basically, this metadata just kind of

487
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:51,420
continues to gather on this blockchain until you have a situation

488
00:27:51,420 --> 00:27:54,340
which is actually much worse than in Fiat.

489
00:27:54,340 --> 00:28:01,160
When you have a Fiat bank account, you do not expect that your bank is going to post your monthly statement

490
00:28:01,160 --> 00:28:05,360
up on the bulletin board outside the bank for everybody to see.

491
00:28:06,020 --> 00:28:09,040
But that is exactly the situation in Bitcoin

492
00:28:09,040 --> 00:28:12,360
and it's not just the people out in your neighborhood who can see it --

493
00:28:12,360 --> 00:28:15,200
it's everybody. Everybody in the world can see

494
00:28:15,560 --> 00:28:18,840
who sent what to whom and when.

495
00:28:19,540 --> 00:28:24,040
The unfortunate consequence of this is that

496
00:28:24,040 --> 00:28:26,620
Bitcoins have a history behind them.

497
00:28:26,940 --> 00:28:30,480
Remember that in Bitcoin, every Bitcoin in existence

498
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:34,180
first came into being as a reward that went to a miner.

499
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:39,620
Once the miner gets that Bitcoin and then they spend it, it starts circulating in the Bitcoin economy.

500
00:28:39,620 --> 00:28:43,780
But because the blockchain is transparent, it's totally "see-through" --

501
00:28:43,780 --> 00:28:48,740
the entire history of every single Bitcoin now in existence can be traced back

502
00:28:48,740 --> 00:28:52,700
to this person, that person, this person, all the way back to when it was mined.

503
00:28:52,700 --> 00:28:56,620
It's as if you have a 10 euro banknote

504
00:28:56,620 --> 00:29:00,620
and on the back of that 10 euro banknote you see a nice list showing

505
00:29:00,620 --> 00:29:04,280
everyone before you who owned that.

506
00:29:04,340 --> 00:29:07,700
What could possibly be the negative consequences of this?

507
00:29:07,700 --> 00:29:11,400
How about innocent people getting falsely accused

508
00:29:11,400 --> 00:29:16,800
because they happen to have received money from somebody who, unbeknownst to them,

509
00:29:16,800 --> 00:29:20,920
was involved in something that was not very good.

510
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:22,580
This is happening in Bitcoin.

511
00:29:23,500 --> 00:29:27,820
There's a reputation in Bitcoin that transfers as well as value

512
00:29:28,580 --> 00:29:31,720
and that is what is profoundly disturbing about having this,

513
00:29:31,720 --> 00:29:33,640
and I call it a surveillance coin.

514
00:29:33,700 --> 00:29:36,460
In a surveillance coin, it's not just value that transmits --

515
00:29:36,460 --> 00:29:38,620
it's also reputation. Which means

516
00:29:38,620 --> 00:29:41,340
if you're accepting money from somebody,

517
00:29:41,340 --> 00:29:46,240
you're also accepting their life, their life history.

518
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:49,920
It's coming to you too. It's not just value.

519
00:29:50,340 --> 00:29:52,860
In contrast, Monero is fungible.

520
00:29:52,860 --> 00:29:56,020
Fungible just means that every unit of currency is

521
00:29:56,020 --> 00:29:58,860
indistinguishable from the other units.

522
00:29:59,160 --> 00:30:02,980
If I have 10 Monero, you have 10 Monero and then

523
00:30:02,980 --> 00:30:07,840
we both trade the 10 Monero to other people, they still look like the 10 Monero.

524
00:30:07,840 --> 00:30:11,920
There's no history. It works just like a cash bill.

525
00:30:11,920 --> 00:30:15,260
It works just how you think cash should work.

526
00:30:15,260 --> 00:30:18,820
And it does this by adding three technologies,

527
00:30:18,820 --> 00:30:23,320
on top of what Bitcoin does, that preserve privacy.

528
00:30:23,320 --> 00:30:25,180
One is ring signatures.

529
00:30:25,180 --> 00:30:26,740
In ring signatures,

530
00:30:26,740 --> 00:30:33,540
the sender of funds is lined up along with 10 other senders of funds

531
00:30:33,540 --> 00:30:40,040
and the only thing that you know happened in that transaction is one out of those 11 people sent money.

532
00:30:40,040 --> 00:30:42,440
It's as if every time you spend money,

533
00:30:42,440 --> 00:30:47,240
now you have 10 friends or 10 random people, 10 decoys

534
00:30:47,300 --> 00:30:51,620
and all that you know, cryptographically, is one of the 11 of you sent the money.

535
00:30:51,700 --> 00:30:53,860
That protects the sender's identity.

536
00:30:53,860 --> 00:30:55,520
How about the receiver's identity?

537
00:30:55,520 --> 00:31:01,640
Well, the receiver's Monero account does not appear unencrypted on the Monero blockchain.

538
00:31:02,220 --> 00:31:06,760
A one-time-use address is what gets put on the blockchain

539
00:31:06,760 --> 00:31:09,680
so that protects the recipients' privacy.

540
00:31:09,680 --> 00:31:12,720
How about the amount that gets sent? Because there are

541
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:15,580
attacks that can be done by knowing,

542
00:31:15,580 --> 00:31:20,200
observing your pattern of how much you spend.

543
00:31:20,900 --> 00:31:23,860
That is covered with the technology RingCT,

544
00:31:23,860 --> 00:31:29,240
which originally was developed for Bitcoin, but actually first got implemented in Monero.

545
00:31:29,240 --> 00:31:33,180
RingCT stands for confidential transactions.

546
00:31:33,180 --> 00:31:37,920
And all these things combine to make Monero's fungibility.

547
00:31:38,920 --> 00:31:40,600
So the end result is that in Monero,

548
00:31:40,600 --> 00:31:44,600
coins are indistinguishable from their another, or they have no memory.

549
00:31:44,600 --> 00:31:46,420
They have no memory of where they've been,

550
00:31:46,420 --> 00:31:50,100
which is really what you want in a money.  Because the opposite,

551
00:31:50,100 --> 00:31:54,060
if you have money that has perfect memory, like it is in Bitcoin,

552
00:31:54,060 --> 00:32:02,540
that unfortunately gets used to falsely associate activities of people who had nothing to do with each other.

553
00:32:02,540 --> 00:32:08,300
Because Monero is fungible, users benefit by having privacy.

554
00:32:08,780 --> 00:32:12,120
The Monero blockchain is public.  Just like Bitcoin,

555
00:32:12,120 --> 00:32:15,540
there is a publicly shared ledger

556
00:32:15,540 --> 00:32:19,440
of who sent what to whom that everybody in the world can get.

557
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:23,240
All you have to do is download the Monero software and you too

558
00:32:23,240 --> 00:32:28,760
can have a copy of this ledger that has the complete history of who sent what to whom.

559
00:32:28,760 --> 00:32:31,100
The difference is that in Monero,

560
00:32:31,100 --> 00:32:35,400
the details of this blockchain are encrypted

561
00:32:35,400 --> 00:32:39,660
so that if you just look at it, you see encrypted garbage.

562
00:32:39,660 --> 00:32:42,300
You cannot do what you can do in Bitcoin, which is

563
00:32:42,300 --> 00:32:47,800
type in somebody's Bitcoin address and immediately see how much money they have.

564
00:32:47,940 --> 00:32:51,500
I represent high net worth clients, institutional investors --

565
00:32:51,500 --> 00:32:54,900
and for them, this kind of "feature" is a show-stopper.

566
00:32:54,900 --> 00:32:59,980
Nobody with wealth wants anyone in the world to type in

567
00:32:59,980 --> 00:33:04,020
their bank account and see instantly how much money they have.

568
00:33:04,020 --> 00:33:08,420
Or see instantly whenever they transfer money out or get money in

569
00:33:08,420 --> 00:33:10,120
as you can do in the Bitcoin blockchain --

570
00:33:10,120 --> 00:33:14,200
you can set a little automated robot 

571
00:33:14,200 --> 00:33:18,640
to watch the blockchain for you and send you an alert on your cellphone

572
00:33:18,640 --> 00:33:24,700
whenever a transaction goes in and out of any Bitcoin address that you choose.

573
00:33:24,700 --> 00:33:28,140
This sort of, kind of casual surveillance,

574
00:33:28,140 --> 00:33:30,640
this invitation to be creepy on your neighbor

575
00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:35,220
is something that is intrinsically part of Bitcoin.

576
00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:37,780
And the deeper it gets into society,

577
00:33:37,780 --> 00:33:39,640
the more insidious it is --

578
00:33:39,640 --> 00:33:44,620
the more of a threat it is to all of our privacy.

579
00:33:46,160 --> 00:33:48,140
A slander that happens is that

580
00:33:48,140 --> 00:33:51,540
"okay, so you have this money that doesn't have a history,

581
00:33:51,540 --> 00:33:55,220
sounds like only the criminals are going to want to use it."

582
00:33:55,820 --> 00:34:00,280
This is a slander.  I'm tired of hearing it.

583
00:34:00,280 --> 00:34:04,060
Monero benefits people who have nothing to hide.

584
00:34:04,060 --> 00:34:05,720
The chief benefit is that

585
00:34:05,720 --> 00:34:08,160
with a money that has no memory,

586
00:34:08,160 --> 00:34:12,040
there's no need to worry about being falsely accused of misdeeds due

587
00:34:12,040 --> 00:34:17,180
to being one hop away from a "bad person."

588
00:34:17,180 --> 00:34:20,920
Basically, when you accept a surveillance coin,

589
00:34:20,920 --> 00:34:26,400
you are accepting the risk that somebody unsavory will be sending you something.

590
00:34:26,400 --> 00:34:29,800
For example, let's say you have a business -- you sell stickers or

591
00:34:29,800 --> 00:34:33,040
shirts, t-shirts, something very innocent --

592
00:34:33,040 --> 00:34:36,940
and you decide that you're going to accept Bitcoin for your business.

593
00:34:36,940 --> 00:34:40,860
Unbeknownst to you, you get a t-shirt order from a gangster,

594
00:34:40,860 --> 00:34:44,360
or some drug dealer, or someone like that.

595
00:34:44,360 --> 00:34:49,640
You had no idea they're a drug dealer, they're just sending you some Bitcoin because you're a t-shirt seller

596
00:34:49,640 --> 00:34:51,220
and this is how you make money --

597
00:34:51,220 --> 00:34:53,140
you need to get money from people.

598
00:34:53,140 --> 00:34:59,280
But because the people watching the blockchain and putting faces and names

599
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:02,320
on addresses on blockchain, don't know that --

600
00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:04,420
so they can try to program that in,

601
00:35:04,420 --> 00:35:08,160
but in the end, it's a probabilistic assessment of

602
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:10,740
"is this bad person really related to you."

603
00:35:11,120 --> 00:35:16,020
The only way that somebody finds out that they've been bitten by this is that

604
00:35:16,020 --> 00:35:21,200
"oh, gee, Coinbase just emailed me and my account's been closed."

605
00:35:21,680 --> 00:35:25,500
Or, even "the Fiat bank that I had associated with my crypto exchange"

606
00:35:25,500 --> 00:35:27,960
"now thinks that there's something suspicious about me,"

607
00:35:27,960 --> 00:35:31,700
"now my Fiat bank has frozen my funds for some reason" --

608
00:35:31,700 --> 00:35:35,840
and it had nothing to do with anything that the person in question did,

609
00:35:35,840 --> 00:35:38,940
it's just that the money itself has this

610
00:35:38,940 --> 00:35:44,280
fatal flaw of... totally having a history behind it.

611
00:35:44,280 --> 00:35:45,980
It's not really money.

612
00:35:45,980 --> 00:35:48,320
It's like Beanie Babies, it's like collectables.

613
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:53,160
It's like collectible items with their own serial number that are getting passed around in this economy.

614
00:35:53,160 --> 00:35:55,860
It's not a real money.

615
00:35:57,540 --> 00:36:01,560
I want to leave with a Nobel Prize-winning idea.

616
00:36:01,560 --> 00:36:03,720
I find that not too many people have heard of this paper.

617
00:36:03,720 --> 00:36:10,400
George Akerlof won the Nobel Prize in Economics for his work on asymmetric information in markets.

618
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:13,520
Anyone here know this paper well?

619
00:36:13,520 --> 00:36:15,540
Okay. Great.

620
00:36:16,720 --> 00:36:18,060
I'll explain it briefly.

621
00:36:18,060 --> 00:36:20,540
There are two kinds of used cars.

622
00:36:20,540 --> 00:36:24,540
There are lemons, which are the bad used cars.

623
00:36:24,540 --> 00:36:29,720
Those are... you buy them and then they break immediately -- those are lemons.

624
00:36:29,720 --> 00:36:33,380
The other kind of used car is a peach -- these are the good cars.

625
00:36:33,380 --> 00:36:36,360
Those owners of the peaches, they did all the maintenance,

626
00:36:36,360 --> 00:36:41,720
they changed the oil, they did all the work to make sure that they have a nice car to sell.

627
00:36:41,720 --> 00:36:46,700
Sellers know whether they're selling a lemon or a peach.

628
00:36:46,700 --> 00:36:50,020
The seller knows that. If you're selling a lemon, you know it.

629
00:36:50,020 --> 00:36:52,580
And you're just trying to make money off the selling of the lemon.

630
00:36:52,580 --> 00:36:56,740
If you have a peach, you know it because you've been doing maintenance on that car.

631
00:36:56,740 --> 00:37:00,100
However, the buyer of the car is ignorant

632
00:37:00,100 --> 00:37:08,620
because both lemon sellers and peach sellers make extra sure that the paint job on the car is extra shiny.

633
00:37:09,180 --> 00:37:11,740
So the cars all look alike to the buyer

634
00:37:11,740 --> 00:37:15,120
so the buyer knows that they are vulnerable in this situation.

635
00:37:15,120 --> 00:37:19,160
The buyer knows that they could end up with a lemon.

636
00:37:19,800 --> 00:37:23,420
Because the buyer is ignorant, but not totally ignorant --

637
00:37:23,420 --> 00:37:26,920
they are actually aware of their own ignorance --

638
00:37:26,920 --> 00:37:34,200
because of that, the buyer then adjusts their offer price to be slightly lower than that of a peach.

639
00:37:34,200 --> 00:37:39,820
The offer price for the car is going to be not quite at the peach price here,

640
00:37:39,820 --> 00:37:42,600
it's going to be slightly lower.

641
00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:44,380
What happens then?

642
00:37:44,380 --> 00:37:50,500
If you're selling a lemon and you see this pretty high price being offered for cars, you're happy.

643
00:37:50,500 --> 00:37:56,880
Because your lemon, which is worth this low price, can sell for this [higher price].

644
00:37:56,880 --> 00:37:58,900
So the lemon sellers are happy --

645
00:37:58,900 --> 00:38:03,000
there are more suckers out there to buy their lemons.

646
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:08,040
How about the peach sellers? The peach sellers are the ones who did the work to have a good car to sell

647
00:38:08,040 --> 00:38:12,400
and now they're seeing this offer price which is less than the peach price.

648
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:16,380
They're discouraged.  And slightly offended --

649
00:38:16,380 --> 00:38:21,740
because all that work they did, all the good work that they did to keep that car good,

650
00:38:21,740 --> 00:38:24,680
and they followed all the rules with their car --

651
00:38:24,680 --> 00:38:31,840
that good behavior is not getting rewarded in the form of a high price coming from the buyer.

652
00:38:31,840 --> 00:38:35,860
So the peach sellers get discouraged and they leave the market.

653
00:38:35,860 --> 00:38:39,080
What happens is that peach sellers leave.

654
00:38:39,080 --> 00:38:41,720
Well, now the buyers figure out that

655
00:38:41,720 --> 00:38:44,600
their chance of buying a lemon has just gone up

656
00:38:44,600 --> 00:38:47,020
and so the price that they're going to offer goes down.

657
00:38:47,020 --> 00:38:52,060
And you have this race to the bottom in which the offer price keeps going down, down, down.

658
00:38:52,060 --> 00:38:54,240
All of the good sellers leave the market

659
00:38:54,240 --> 00:39:00,300
because they are not being justly compensated for the work that they've done.

660
00:39:00,300 --> 00:39:03,460
What does it have to do with cryptocurrency?

661
00:39:03,720 --> 00:39:05,780
Surveillance coins

662
00:39:05,780 --> 00:39:10,820
which have a total record and a total history of who had them

663
00:39:10,820 --> 00:39:14,080
are the used cars of cryptocurrency.

664
00:39:14,740 --> 00:39:19,520
Whenever you buy Bitcoin from somebody, and you don't know the history of that Bitcoin,

665
00:39:19,520 --> 00:39:22,520
you are the used car buyer in this situation.

666
00:39:22,520 --> 00:39:24,900
You don't know if you accept this Bitcoin,

667
00:39:24,900 --> 00:39:31,320
"am I going to be just fine" or "am I going to be falsely accused of some who-knows-what?"

668
00:39:31,320 --> 00:39:37,260
Who knows what possible crime could have been done with the person who used to own that Bitcoin.

669
00:39:37,260 --> 00:39:39,240
You don't know if that's going to happen to you.

670
00:39:39,240 --> 00:39:46,800
So, as a Bitcoin receiver, you are in the position of the used car buyer.

671
00:39:47,980 --> 00:39:51,720
What, in this paper, is identified as

672
00:39:51,720 --> 00:39:56,520
a means to avoid this race to the bottom -- is a signal.

673
00:39:57,060 --> 00:39:59,680
So in the car market, for example --

674
00:39:59,680 --> 00:40:02,180
there's probably something similar to this in Europe,

675
00:40:02,180 --> 00:40:05,560
where you can type in the serial number, the VIN number of a car

676
00:40:05,560 --> 00:40:07,780
and then you get a report...

677
00:40:07,780 --> 00:40:09,920
you can see if it's been in an accident...

678
00:40:09,920 --> 00:40:12,720
this doesn't exist in Europe?  Okay, well,

679
00:40:13,100 --> 00:40:15,020
Business idea for somebody...

680
00:40:15,100 --> 00:40:17,940
it exists in the United States. It's called Carfax

681
00:40:17,940 --> 00:40:22,820
and you type in the serial number of a car and all of its past history comes up.

682
00:40:22,820 --> 00:40:28,480
That information can equalize the playing field between the buyers and the sellers of cars.

683
00:40:28,480 --> 00:40:30,600
This also happens in the job market.

684
00:40:30,600 --> 00:40:33,320
Education is a similar situation.

685
00:40:33,320 --> 00:40:38,260
If you are a boss, you're hiring a worker -- you have a hundred workers out there applying for jobs.

686
00:40:38,360 --> 00:40:40,340
They all look the same to you because it's like

687
00:40:40,340 --> 00:40:41,900
everyone starts looking the same,

688
00:40:41,900 --> 00:40:44,560
all the resumes look the same after a while.

689
00:40:44,560 --> 00:40:49,100
So how are the sellers of their labor going to distinguish themselves?

690
00:40:49,100 --> 00:40:50,740
They're going to have a signal.

691
00:40:50,740 --> 00:40:56,600
Education is a signal just like information in the used car market is.

692
00:40:56,740 --> 00:41:01,300
Basically, the sellers of labor take it upon themselves to get

693
00:41:01,300 --> 00:41:06,520
an educational credential to signal to the buyer of labor

694
00:41:06,520 --> 00:41:09,880
that their labor is going to be worth more.

695
00:41:09,980 --> 00:41:14,220
Unfortunately, what happens is that the sellers of education then figure this out

696
00:41:14,220 --> 00:41:16,400
and then they just start selling education

697
00:41:16,400 --> 00:41:20,840
because they know that the people coming for the education are just going

698
00:41:20,840 --> 00:41:22,900
to get an employment signal,

699
00:41:23,160 --> 00:41:27,120
and so the actual purpose of the education gets lost.

700
00:41:27,120 --> 00:41:31,040
This is happening in non-fungible cryptocurrencies as well.

701
00:41:31,040 --> 00:41:34,720
Right now, anybody who signs up for an account

702
00:41:34,720 --> 00:41:36,320
at a centralized exchange

703
00:41:36,320 --> 00:41:40,060
has to do all sorts of degrading things.

704
00:41:40,060 --> 00:41:42,220
You have to hold up a picture of your ID,

705
00:41:42,220 --> 00:41:46,100
you have to make a little handwritten note that says this "this is my name,"

706
00:41:46,100 --> 00:41:50,580
you have to basically submit all this stuff just to be deemed worthy enough

707
00:41:50,580 --> 00:41:54,360
to participate in this cryptocurrency economy.

708
00:41:54,360 --> 00:41:57,320
That is a signal in this sense too.

709
00:41:57,320 --> 00:42:00,300
But what's interesting is that in cryptocurrency,

710
00:42:00,300 --> 00:42:06,720
currently, the exchanges bear the burden of due diligence on their customers.

711
00:42:06,960 --> 00:42:11,480
It's an expense for the exchanges to be doing, to check all these people out.

712
00:42:11,480 --> 00:42:16,080
It could be that in the future that just like in the education market and in the car market,

713
00:42:16,080 --> 00:42:20,420
it's the seller who's going to have to increasingly go through hoops

714
00:42:20,420 --> 00:42:25,460
basically to prove their worthiness in this whole system.

715
00:42:27,120 --> 00:42:29,100
All right.  So just to take a step back,

716
00:42:29,100 --> 00:42:31,500
I've gone over scarcity in Bitcoin and Monero,

717
00:42:31,500 --> 00:42:34,980
and I've gone over fungibility and privacy in Bitcoin and Monero.

718
00:42:34,980 --> 00:42:36,340
And if we step back,

719
00:42:36,340 --> 00:42:41,360
I can identify what I think is a reason why crypto is not going to go away --

720
00:42:41,360 --> 00:42:43,780
why it's here to stay.

721
00:42:44,220 --> 00:42:45,760
Now we have the Internet,

722
00:42:45,760 --> 00:42:48,940
we have mobile telecommunication --

723
00:42:48,940 --> 00:42:53,000
everybody here has at least one device

724
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:56,480
that is extremely good at copying packets.

725
00:42:56,760 --> 00:42:59,960
That's what cellphones are, they're just packet copiers.

726
00:43:00,460 --> 00:43:01,760
When you fetch your email,

727
00:43:01,760 --> 00:43:06,400
you are copying packets from the email server to your phone to check.

728
00:43:06,400 --> 00:43:12,840
We've become just extraordinarily efficient at copying ones and zeros globally.

729
00:43:12,960 --> 00:43:16,740
The marginal cost of shuttling these bits around is zero.

730
00:43:16,940 --> 00:43:19,180
So, what is rare in that world,

731
00:43:19,180 --> 00:43:23,220
what is rare in a world where every human on earth basically

732
00:43:23,220 --> 00:43:28,980
has the ability to copy ones and zeros anywhere around the world for free?

733
00:43:28,980 --> 00:43:32,340
Well, it's going to be digital scarcity

734
00:43:32,340 --> 00:43:33,760
and digital privacy.

735
00:43:33,760 --> 00:43:36,080
Digital scarcity in the sense that

736
00:43:36,080 --> 00:43:39,400
there's a sequence of ones and zeros that only you know

737
00:43:39,400 --> 00:43:42,280
which is cryptocurrency - that's the private key.

738
00:43:42,280 --> 00:43:44,260
And privacy, in which you

739
00:43:44,260 --> 00:43:46,900
have a sequence of ones and zeros also that you only know

740
00:43:46,900 --> 00:43:48,980
and that you haven't shared with everyone

741
00:43:48,980 --> 00:43:53,320
like you've shared the contents of your lunch on Facebook with the entire world

742
00:43:53,820 --> 00:43:58,680
and other details of your life that are basically copied around.

743
00:43:58,680 --> 00:44:02,260
These are the two things that are going to be scarce in the future:

744
00:44:02,260 --> 00:44:05,700
digital scarcity and digital privacy.

745
00:44:05,700 --> 00:44:07,960
Cryptocurrencies offer both,

746
00:44:07,960 --> 00:44:10,040
and cryptocurrencies like Monero

747
00:44:10,040 --> 00:44:13,540
especially offer both because they offer privacy as well.

748
00:44:21,890 --> 00:44:24,040
[Part 3:  Community]  CORONET INSTRUCTIONAL FILMS - "WHAT IS MONEY?" (1947):  So the values of the money we use every day

749
00:44:24,040 --> 00:44:26,350
are the values fixed by the government.

750
00:44:26,470 --> 00:44:28,510
The paper bills and even the coins

751
00:44:28,510 --> 00:44:30,510
are not in themselves actually worth

752
00:44:30,510 --> 00:44:32,380
the amounts they represent.

753
00:44:32,380 --> 00:44:35,320
Their face values, however, are guaranteed --

754
00:44:35,320 --> 00:44:38,510
not only by huge reserves of gold and silver,

755
00:44:38,510 --> 00:44:40,600
but by the stability of the government

756
00:44:40,600 --> 00:44:42,520
which fixed those values.

757
00:44:42,520 --> 00:44:44,350
As long as people remain confident

758
00:44:44,350 --> 00:44:47,210
that our government is strong and secure,

759
00:44:47,310 --> 00:44:48,620
they will continue freely

760
00:44:48,620 --> 00:44:50,680
to accept and spend its money

761
00:44:50,680 --> 00:44:52,750
without questioning the value.

762
00:44:54,370 --> 00:44:56,930
DR. DANIEL KIM (December 27, 2019): 
In the past when we've had Fiat money,

763
00:44:56,930 --> 00:45:00,030
basically, your nationality

764
00:45:00,750 --> 00:45:04,510
told you what community you belong to, for purposes of money.

765
00:45:04,510 --> 00:45:07,750
If you're born in the Eurozone, well, you use Euros.

766
00:45:07,750 --> 00:45:10,870
I was born American, so I use the US Dollar.

767
00:45:11,050 --> 00:45:13,390
That kind of gets told to you at birth

768
00:45:13,390 --> 00:45:15,990
as an accident of where you were born.

769
00:45:15,990 --> 00:45:17,350
Now with cryptocurrencies,

770
00:45:17,350 --> 00:45:24,790
because the system of bookkeeping is a decentralized network of computers that can be worldwide,

771
00:45:24,790 --> 00:45:28,790
this idea of association is now fluid,

772
00:45:28,790 --> 00:45:35,110
it's more open.  It's really like the Reformation of the Church...

773
00:45:36,030 --> 00:45:39,070
another famous German, Martin Luther

774
00:45:39,070 --> 00:45:43,970
who liberated theology from the kind of

775
00:45:43,970 --> 00:45:46,190
centralized control of the Catholic Church

776
00:45:46,190 --> 00:45:51,270
and liberated this ability for people to elect

777
00:45:51,270 --> 00:45:54,510
to worship in the way that they chose.

778
00:45:54,730 --> 00:46:00,370
A similar sort of thing is now possible because of Nakamoto consensus,

779
00:46:00,450 --> 00:46:03,850
now 11 years and a month old.

780
00:46:03,850 --> 00:46:08,630
Now it's possible for each one of us to pick a group,

781
00:46:08,630 --> 00:46:10,850
pick your own church, pick your own...

782
00:46:10,890 --> 00:46:12,450
like, that's not really quite right

783
00:46:12,450 --> 00:46:13,450
but I think you get what I'm saying.

784
00:46:13,450 --> 00:46:17,490
You can pick your own group of people who agree

785
00:46:17,570 --> 00:46:21,790
on certain characteristics that they want their money to have

786
00:46:21,790 --> 00:46:26,130
and you are free to associate with each of those groups.

787
00:46:26,250 --> 00:46:30,730
So, Bitcoin is one such group -- one such group that apparently doesn't...

788
00:46:30,730 --> 00:46:34,090
really, is not too bothered by the fact that

789
00:46:34,090 --> 00:46:39,410
the currency has this perfect knowledge of history for every single coin that's out there.

790
00:46:39,410 --> 00:46:45,550
And that is a large association of people, all of whom have the shared belief

791
00:46:45,550 --> 00:46:51,330
that the token that they are keeping track of on their blockchain is money.

792
00:46:51,330 --> 00:46:54,230
So there's a similar sort of community

793
00:46:54,230 --> 00:46:59,430
formation that happens with the cryptocurrencies.

794
00:47:00,770 --> 00:47:03,290
So I'd like to share some of my observations about the Monero community --

795
00:47:03,290 --> 00:47:07,050
and by the way, I'm volunteering to be here,

796
00:47:07,050 --> 00:47:10,070
I've paid my own dime to come out here from Boston

797
00:47:10,070 --> 00:47:14,610
to share what I think

798
00:47:14,610 --> 00:47:18,430
my understanding of the current status of cryptocurrencies is with you --

799
00:47:18,430 --> 00:47:21,910
Monero is basically run like a charity.

800
00:47:21,910 --> 00:47:23,710
There is no company behind it.

801
00:47:23,710 --> 00:47:29,370
There's no pre-mine, there's no scammy way for people to get rich.

802
00:47:29,370 --> 00:47:34,430
All of the Monero in existence were given in the past to a miner

803
00:47:34,430 --> 00:47:38,890
who was doing the accounting work to help support the network, just like in Bitcoin.

804
00:47:39,110 --> 00:47:41,930
So both Bitcoin and Monero have the positive aspect that there's

805
00:47:41,930 --> 00:47:46,670
no central company steering things to kind of make a profit --

806
00:47:46,670 --> 00:47:50,690
no, it's totally open-source grassroots --

807
00:47:51,090 --> 00:47:55,690
just normal, everyday people choosing to run some

808
00:47:55,690 --> 00:47:57,790
peer-to-peer network software on their computer

809
00:47:57,790 --> 00:48:02,530
and join this community who have this shared

810
00:48:02,730 --> 00:48:06,470
ethos in what they think that money should be.

811
00:48:07,530 --> 00:48:12,990
So the Monero community, I find to be idealistic, scientific, and yet very welcoming.

812
00:48:13,370 --> 00:48:15,150
It's very chill.

813
00:48:15,550 --> 00:48:20,110
There's a lot of "alpha geek" happening in some other coins,

814
00:48:20,110 --> 00:48:24,090
in which people are just really out there on Twitter

815
00:48:24,090 --> 00:48:28,610
and they just really want everyone to know that they're the "alpha-est" geek out there.

816
00:48:28,610 --> 00:48:31,250
That kind of thing is refreshingly absent in Monero,

817
00:48:31,250 --> 00:48:32,550
it's very chill.

818
00:48:32,550 --> 00:48:36,390
It's one thing that kind of I like about this whole vibe here at c3 --

819
00:48:36,390 --> 00:48:39,430
it's very chill!   There's just a lot of people lounging.

820
00:48:39,430 --> 00:48:43,750
That sort of shared relaxed atmosphere is something that I've

821
00:48:43,750 --> 00:48:47,430
personally observed at the Monero meetups that I've been to.

822
00:48:47,610 --> 00:48:50,810
Monero Research Lab -- we have full-time PhDs

823
00:48:51,150 --> 00:48:54,590
who do nothing but cryptographic research.

824
00:48:54,590 --> 00:48:57,290
There's sort of a pipeline of research in which

825
00:48:57,290 --> 00:49:00,070
pure science gets done at Monero Research Lab.

826
00:49:00,070 --> 00:49:03,230
Then, implementations of the promising idea get tested out,

827
00:49:03,230 --> 00:49:08,890
then there's an audit process, that we actually employ

828
00:49:09,090 --> 00:49:12,270
external auditors, to look at implementations of code --

829
00:49:12,270 --> 00:49:16,850
once those are clean, then we go to release.

830
00:49:16,850 --> 00:49:21,670
There's this pipeline of technology from science to engineering

831
00:49:21,670 --> 00:49:25,210
that gets pushed out in the actual release of the Monero

832
00:49:25,210 --> 00:49:27,670
core software.

833
00:49:27,670 --> 00:49:33,170
The LMDB database is another kind of interesting example of how far Monero has come.

834
00:49:33,170 --> 00:49:34,950
In the early days of Monero,

835
00:49:34,950 --> 00:49:38,330
the entire blockchain was stored in RAM,

836
00:49:38,330 --> 00:49:39,830
if you can believe that.

837
00:49:41,590 --> 00:49:44,690
So, that kind of puts a hard limit on how big your blockchain can be

838
00:49:44,690 --> 00:49:46,430
if it has to fit in RAM.

839
00:49:46,430 --> 00:49:51,350
The LMDB block database -- which was the brainchild of Howard Chu,

840
00:49:51,350 --> 00:49:54,590
who is one of the very frequent contributors

841
00:49:54,590 --> 00:50:02,710
and an open-source Linux guru -- was added to Monero.

842
00:50:03,230 --> 00:50:06,130
Monero is actually number three in terms of developer effort

843
00:50:06,130 --> 00:50:12,230
if you rank the coins, not by market cap, but by actual developer effort.

844
00:50:12,230 --> 00:50:14,750
It goes Bitcoin, Ethereum and then Monero.

845
00:50:14,750 --> 00:50:16,710
It turns out that,

846
00:50:16,890 --> 00:50:18,150
well, in my opinion,

847
00:50:18,150 --> 00:50:21,610
the killer app of Nakamoto consensus is money

848
00:50:21,610 --> 00:50:27,070
because you have a ledger of scarcity that's being shared.

849
00:50:27,070 --> 00:50:30,490
And what more natural thing is there for

850
00:50:30,490 --> 00:50:34,070
a shared idea of scarcity, than money?

851
00:50:34,070 --> 00:50:37,690
But it turns out that money is non-trivial to get right --

852
00:50:37,690 --> 00:50:39,510
it needs to be thought through.

853
00:50:39,510 --> 00:50:44,550
These things like... should the money have a complete history behind it,

854
00:50:44,550 --> 00:50:47,490
or should it be fungible?

855
00:50:47,490 --> 00:50:49,390
Like that kind of basic idea, that

856
00:50:49,390 --> 00:50:53,390
basic engineering design decision, has to be made early on

857
00:50:53,390 --> 00:50:59,270
because the technology that's needed to bake in fungibility to Monero -- it's highly non-trivial.

858
00:50:59,630 --> 00:51:01,890
Monero has been at it for 6 years now

859
00:51:01,890 --> 00:51:04,030
and has made great improvements in that.

860
00:51:04,030 --> 00:51:07,650
And the way that the social contract is,

861
00:51:07,650 --> 00:51:12,170
I just can't see this happening in Bitcoin.

862
00:51:12,170 --> 00:51:15,410
There are volunteer workgroups for community outreach

863
00:51:15,410 --> 00:51:17,150
and, as I said before,

864
00:51:17,150 --> 00:51:24,690
all of the funding to support all of this is completely 100% shaking the tin cup

865
00:51:24,690 --> 00:51:28,130
and asking for people to donate out of the kindness of their hearts.

866
00:51:28,130 --> 00:51:31,290
And the people in the Monero community do that.

867
00:51:31,390 --> 00:51:33,310
They actually step up to the plate

868
00:51:33,310 --> 00:51:35,650
and they fulfill these [funding requests].

869
00:51:35,650 --> 00:51:38,370
But if you look at the annual budget --

870
00:51:38,370 --> 00:51:41,290
if Monero were a company, which it's not --

871
00:51:41,290 --> 00:51:44,850
but if Monero were a company, and you looked at its operating budget,

872
00:51:44,850 --> 00:51:49,430
you would be astounded at how minuscule, how tiny it is.

873
00:51:49,430 --> 00:51:52,690
And that's because you have idealistic, passionate people

874
00:51:52,690 --> 00:51:56,750
working on this project in true open-source spirit,

875
00:51:56,750 --> 00:51:59,550
often on their spare time.

876
00:52:01,040 --> 00:52:02,960
All right.

877
00:52:06,330 --> 00:52:07,330
So, just to summarize:

878
00:52:07,330 --> 00:52:12,430
Monero is what Bitcoin noobs think they bought.

879
00:52:13,570 --> 00:52:16,230
So I'm going to switch hats a little bit.

880
00:52:16,230 --> 00:52:19,970
As I mentioned, one of my jobs before going full time in crypto --

881
00:52:19,970 --> 00:52:22,370
I was head of research at a hedge fund,

882
00:52:22,370 --> 00:52:27,750
and so the question of thinking of cryptocurrency as an investment comes up.

883
00:52:27,750 --> 00:52:32,330
And of course because there have been these spectacular gains in the price of Bitcoin,

884
00:52:32,330 --> 00:52:34,110
it gets discussed a lot.

885
00:52:34,110 --> 00:52:39,150
One thing that is positive about Monero's culture is that it is generally

886
00:52:39,150 --> 00:52:42,530
gauche to talk about prices,

887
00:52:42,530 --> 00:52:46,610
and returns, and the price going to the moon.

888
00:52:47,030 --> 00:52:49,250
I hope that, well...

889
00:52:49,250 --> 00:52:53,210
I have some background in academic finance --

890
00:52:53,210 --> 00:52:57,410
there's a paper that I co-authored on the effect of liquidity on asset prices

891
00:52:57,410 --> 00:53:01,970
that won a "paper of the year" award in applied finance...

892
00:53:02,290 --> 00:53:05,730
and that, coupled with the Nobel Prize that I just explained --

893
00:53:05,730 --> 00:53:12,090
hopefully, I can put a respectable enough academic sheen on the discussion of

894
00:53:12,090 --> 00:53:18,790
the finance and economics to be forgivable by the Monero community.

895
00:53:18,790 --> 00:53:22,490
But the fact is that this project is going to attract investors,

896
00:53:22,490 --> 00:53:24,190
it's going to attract "hodlers."

897
00:53:24,190 --> 00:53:26,390
It's a socioeconomic hedge.

898
00:53:26,390 --> 00:53:29,230
There are lots of investments, there are lots of ETFs out there.

899
00:53:29,230 --> 00:53:33,630
If you believe that companies should be environmentally sustainable

900
00:53:33,630 --> 00:53:37,290
and that their corporate boards should have official policies that

901
00:53:37,290 --> 00:53:41,390
mandate sustainability in one sense or another,

902
00:53:41,390 --> 00:53:45,490
there are ETFs that will only invest in those companies.

903
00:53:45,570 --> 00:53:48,990
So it's possible to be basically an ideological investor

904
00:53:48,990 --> 00:53:51,430
so if you really care about sustainability

905
00:53:51,590 --> 00:53:55,630
then there's an investment for you.

906
00:53:55,630 --> 00:53:58,890
If, for example... say Islamic finance --

907
00:53:58,890 --> 00:54:03,050
they are not cool with the idea of interest being paid on loans.

908
00:54:03,050 --> 00:54:07,030
So you have another subset of Islamic finance investments

909
00:54:07,030 --> 00:54:10,550
that don't involve paying interest on loans.

910
00:54:10,770 --> 00:54:17,030
Monero, if you look at it in a similar lens, is basically an ideal hedge

911
00:54:17,030 --> 00:54:19,850
for people who have two characteristics.

912
00:54:19,850 --> 00:54:23,710
One is that they're concerned about mismanagement and corruption

913
00:54:23,710 --> 00:54:27,350
on the part of central banks managing Fiat

914
00:54:27,350 --> 00:54:33,510
and two, they're gravely disturbed by the state of surveillance capitalism

915
00:54:33,510 --> 00:54:38,290
in which everything about all of us is recorded all the time

916
00:54:38,290 --> 00:54:41,050
and will stay forever,

917
00:54:41,290 --> 00:54:45,490
and we have little or no control over that.

918
00:54:46,350 --> 00:54:48,090
It's done in the name of security

919
00:54:48,090 --> 00:54:52,090
but unfortunately, if you push that line too far,

920
00:54:52,090 --> 00:54:55,430
you cease to become an open and free society.

921
00:54:55,430 --> 00:55:02,410
There are reasons that we, in the West, have put limits on the powers of government

922
00:55:02,410 --> 00:55:08,890
and that is because of an awareness of what happens when there are no limits on the powers of government.

923
00:55:09,450 --> 00:55:11,850
So a project like Monero is a hedge --

924
00:55:11,850 --> 00:55:16,370
it's basically a "put your money where your mouth is" kind of thing

925
00:55:16,370 --> 00:55:20,170
for people who have strong feelings on those two points --

926
00:55:20,390 --> 00:55:23,130
so it's just going to attract investors.

927
00:55:23,130 --> 00:55:28,810
Gresham's law is an economic concept that the best form of money gets hoarded.

928
00:55:28,810 --> 00:55:31,050
So people keep the best kind of money

929
00:55:31,050 --> 00:55:34,890
and the inferior form of money, they're going to use that to spend.

930
00:55:34,890 --> 00:55:38,270
But the good stuff, they're going to keep for themselves. That's Gresham's law.

931
00:55:38,530 --> 00:55:40,590
So with Monero, this tends to happen.

932
00:55:40,590 --> 00:55:43,330
A lot of people in Monero used to be in Bitcoin,

933
00:55:43,330 --> 00:55:45,970
but now, whenever they deal with Bitcoin,

934
00:55:45,970 --> 00:55:52,570
they find their heads consumed with all these worries about traceability

935
00:55:53,850 --> 00:55:55,530
and so on.

936
00:55:55,530 --> 00:55:57,210
It's refreshing to come to Monero

937
00:55:57,210 --> 00:55:58,470
where you don't have to worry about that

938
00:55:58,470 --> 00:56:00,570
because the currency is actually fungible.

939
00:56:00,570 --> 00:56:03,790
And because it's fungible, it becomes a superior form of money

940
00:56:03,790 --> 00:56:06,170
that gets hoarded by Gresham's law.

941
00:56:06,170 --> 00:56:11,190
That's another tendency that's going to happen:  for people to want to keep the Monero

942
00:56:11,190 --> 00:56:13,370
and spend the other stuff.

943
00:56:13,450 --> 00:56:16,000
Also, capital gains taxes, at least in America.  

944
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:17,930
And I believe in Germany too --

945
00:56:17,930 --> 00:56:22,230
if you hold an asset for over a year in Germany, you don't have to pay gains on it,

946
00:56:22,230 --> 00:56:25,070
that's what I've read, is that right, in Germany?... --

947
00:56:25,510 --> 00:56:28,390
so basically, the tax law

948
00:56:28,390 --> 00:56:32,930
promotes looking at those cryptocurrency projects that are solid

949
00:56:32,930 --> 00:56:35,890
and have a real reason to exist,

950
00:56:35,890 --> 00:56:39,310
and so that is also going to attract investment money to Monero.

951
00:56:39,310 --> 00:56:45,330
The question is: can these new investors integrate into the community?

952
00:56:45,570 --> 00:56:48,590
Part of what I do as a consultant is I try to bridge these worlds.

953
00:56:48,590 --> 00:56:52,290
I try to take these new investors

954
00:56:53,210 --> 00:56:57,450
whose inclination might be to want to talk to the "manager of Monero"

955
00:56:57,450 --> 00:57:00,450
and have a word with them about the release schedule,

956
00:57:00,450 --> 00:57:02,730
and they want this and this and this feature

957
00:57:02,770 --> 00:57:04,730
built into the next release --

958
00:57:04,730 --> 00:57:06,370
basically, this whole mentality of

959
00:57:06,370 --> 00:57:11,450
"I own some tokens therefore I'm your customer and you have to do what I say"

960
00:57:11,450 --> 00:57:15,690
which of course falls completely flat on its face in any open-source project --

961
00:57:15,690 --> 00:57:18,790
that's not how changes happen in Linux;

962
00:57:18,790 --> 00:57:21,270
nobody goes to Linus and demands...

963
00:57:21,270 --> 00:57:25,950
makes ultimatums on what they want to see in the next rollout.

964
00:57:26,230 --> 00:57:28,610
So basically, one thing that I'm doing is

965
00:57:28,610 --> 00:57:31,870
trying to bridge these worlds of the traditional investment world

966
00:57:31,870 --> 00:57:35,590
and that of the "OG" cryptocurrency open-source world

967
00:57:35,590 --> 00:57:37,590
that's surrounding us here.

968
00:57:37,590 --> 00:57:38,910
So community investors,

969
00:57:38,910 --> 00:57:42,070
I posit, are a subset of investors that

970
00:57:42,070 --> 00:57:46,670
can be valued members of the community.  Instead of being

971
00:57:46,670 --> 00:57:48,830
entitled and thinking that they're customers,

972
00:57:48,830 --> 00:57:52,370
they'll take the attitude that they're helping to bear financial risk

973
00:57:52,370 --> 00:57:54,270
on behalf of the project.

974
00:57:54,550 --> 00:57:58,410
They will do things like take self-custody of their coins

975
00:57:58,410 --> 00:58:01,850
and not just leave them on exchange -- which lots of people do.

976
00:58:01,850 --> 00:58:04,590
Lots of people leave their crypto on exchanges,

977
00:58:04,590 --> 00:58:07,130
then the exchange gets hacked, they lose their money.

978
00:58:07,130 --> 00:58:09,770
The reality is: if the money is on the exchange

979
00:58:09,770 --> 00:58:12,070
and you don't own the private key then it's not your crypto.

980
00:58:12,070 --> 00:58:14,570
It's actually an "IOU" that you own for crypto,

981
00:58:14,570 --> 00:58:16,990
it's not crypto that you own.

982
00:58:17,690 --> 00:58:24,230
And there's a list of aspects that I think are proper for

983
00:58:24,230 --> 00:58:31,810
a community type of investor to be a solid member of the Monero community.

984
00:58:33,170 --> 00:58:36,050
One thing to do, also, is to make sure that

985
00:58:36,050 --> 00:58:41,290
there are proper legal structures around one's ownership of cryptocurrency.

986
00:58:41,290 --> 00:58:49,610
One of the subsets of the traditional finance world that I help to bridge with cryptocurrencies is that of trusts.

987
00:58:49,610 --> 00:58:53,210
In a statutory [civil] law kind of regime like Germany,

988
00:58:53,210 --> 00:58:55,470
the whole concept of trust might be a little foreign

989
00:58:55,470 --> 00:58:57,630
because it comes from English common law.

990
00:58:57,630 --> 00:59:01,530
But the idea is that a trust is a legal entity,

991
00:59:01,530 --> 00:59:02,510
it's a legal thing.

992
00:59:02,510 --> 00:59:04,070
It's kind of a company

993
00:59:04,070 --> 00:59:07,650
but it's a different category of legal structure.

994
00:59:07,650 --> 00:59:10,050
A trust is a

995
00:59:10,050 --> 00:59:13,830
kind of like a holding vessel for funds that

996
00:59:13,830 --> 00:59:19,030
a giver wants to give to beneficiaries -- but not immediately.

997
00:59:19,390 --> 00:59:21,010
Basically, there are three people involved.

998
00:59:21,010 --> 00:59:25,450
There's a grantor who has wealth and wants to transfer it to the beneficiaries

999
00:59:25,450 --> 00:59:28,970
but not just outright, they want the money to go into a trust.

1000
00:59:28,970 --> 00:59:32,430
So the grantor will work to make the rules of the trust

1001
00:59:32,430 --> 00:59:35,810
and then transfer property into the trust.

1002
00:59:35,810 --> 00:59:38,310
As part of the document that defines the trust,

1003
00:59:38,310 --> 00:59:42,590
you have a list of beneficiaries who could ultimately benefit from the property

1004
00:59:42,590 --> 00:59:45,330
and then you have a third party which is the trustee.

1005
00:59:45,330 --> 00:59:49,570
The trustee is the legal owner of the assets that are given into trust --

1006
00:59:49,570 --> 00:59:52,850
but the legal owner is with conditions.

1007
00:59:52,850 --> 00:59:55,670
The legal owner cannot do whatever they want with the property,

1008
00:59:55,670 --> 01:00:00,250
they have to follow the instructions that are in the trust document.

1009
01:00:01,370 --> 01:00:05,670
So in effect, this is what crypto people would think of as a smart contract.

1010
01:00:05,670 --> 01:00:09,910
It's kind of an original old-school legal contract,

1011
01:00:09,910 --> 01:00:15,230
and if you're careful with

1012
01:00:15,230 --> 01:00:19,410
which jurisdictions you place the various players in the trust,

1013
01:00:19,410 --> 01:00:22,650
there are advantages that can be had --

1014
01:00:22,650 --> 01:00:25,470
which are very dependent on jurisdiction,

1015
01:00:25,470 --> 01:00:29,490
and it's just completely impossible for me to spell it out

1016
01:00:29,490 --> 01:00:31,250
because of the complexity of this --

1017
01:00:31,250 --> 01:00:35,850
but possible benefits are legal tax reduction,

1018
01:00:35,850 --> 01:00:37,930
protection from being sued --

1019
01:00:37,930 --> 01:00:41,490
in other words, if money is in a trust,

1020
01:00:41,490 --> 01:00:45,010
it's not the giver's money anymore,

1021
01:00:45,010 --> 01:00:48,110
it's not the wealth owner's money anymore, it's the trust's money --

1022
01:00:48,110 --> 01:00:51,970
if somebody sues the wealth owner, the wealth is gone.

1023
01:00:51,970 --> 01:00:54,430
It's not theirs anymore, it belongs the trust.

1024
01:00:54,430 --> 01:00:59,430
And then there are trust laws that protect that money from lawsuits as well.

1025
01:01:00,070 --> 01:01:03,350
Most people think "well, you know, I'm at low risk.

1026
01:01:03,350 --> 01:01:07,370
I'm a nice guy, I don't hurt anybody, nobody's going to sue me."

1027
01:01:07,370 --> 01:01:11,370
But one glaring exception to this is divorce --

1028
01:01:11,370 --> 01:01:18,550
so people routinely get robbed by people who they only recently married, 

1029
01:01:18,550 --> 01:01:22,870
and it turns out that irrevocable trusts made before marriage --

1030
01:01:22,870 --> 01:01:25,330
you have to do it before or otherwise it won't count --

1031
01:01:25,330 --> 01:01:31,350
but it's one of the only things that can survive a challenge.

1032
01:01:32,570 --> 01:01:34,330
Also, legal enhanced privacy.

1033
01:01:34,330 --> 01:01:37,470
So, depending on the jurisdiction in which you place the trust,

1034
01:01:37,470 --> 01:01:43,690
you could benefit from enhanced privacy protecting those assets.

1035
01:01:43,690 --> 01:01:47,030
Actually, relevant to people who are not Americans,

1036
01:01:47,110 --> 01:01:49,490
you may or may not be aware of this,

1037
01:01:49,490 --> 01:01:54,270
but there's a saying within estate planning and wealth management

1038
01:01:54,270 --> 01:01:57,150
that "America is the new Switzerland."

1039
01:01:57,350 --> 01:02:02,170
And this is because America has laws that are asymmetric.

1040
01:02:02,170 --> 01:02:06,110
America has a law called FATCA, which was put in by Obama,

1041
01:02:06,110 --> 01:02:14,250
which requires worldwide financial institutions to send data on Americans back to the IRS.

1042
01:02:14,250 --> 01:02:18,090
This is why it's almost impossible for an American to get a German bank account

1043
01:02:18,170 --> 01:02:20,930
because the German bank account

1044
01:02:20,930 --> 01:02:24,810
will have a whole bunch of burdensome reporting requirements

1045
01:02:24,810 --> 01:02:28,530
to the IRS to take on this American customer.

1046
01:02:28,750 --> 01:02:30,590
That's why Americans have a lot of trouble

1047
01:02:30,590 --> 01:02:34,250
when they go overseas to work.

1048
01:02:34,690 --> 01:02:39,050
In reaction to this, the other countries of the world came up with what's called CRS

1049
01:02:39,050 --> 01:02:41,210
which is the "Common Reporting Standard."

1050
01:02:41,390 --> 01:02:44,970
The idea is the same, for example, 

1051
01:02:44,970 --> 01:02:48,090
one European government wants to make sure that

1052
01:02:48,270 --> 01:02:52,330
its citizens are not trying to hide money in Australia,

1053
01:02:52,370 --> 01:02:55,770
so they sign this agreement

1054
01:02:55,850 --> 01:02:59,330
for all these countries to share financial information with each other

1055
01:02:59,330 --> 01:03:02,650
to make sure that nobody's cheating on their taxes.

1056
01:03:02,910 --> 01:03:06,510
So there's a bunch of countries that have signed on to this CRS --

1057
01:03:06,510 --> 01:03:09,350
but America is not one of them.

1058
01:03:09,870 --> 01:03:11,690
Thus lies the asymmetry,

1059
01:03:12,390 --> 01:03:18,310
that for US citizens who doing affairs abroad,

1060
01:03:18,310 --> 01:03:20,310
like legitimate businesses abroad,

1061
01:03:20,310 --> 01:03:23,150
all of that information gets sent back to the IRS.

1062
01:03:23,150 --> 01:03:28,710
But for a non-US person who sets up financial affairs in the US,

1063
01:03:28,710 --> 01:03:33,470
there is no obligation for the US to send the information back to the home country.

1064
01:03:33,690 --> 01:03:37,620
So thus the saying, "America is the new Switzerland."

1065
01:03:46,120 --> 01:03:51,090
[Part 4: Correlation]  GATEWAY FILM PRODUCTIONS - "WAVE MOTION: INTERFERENCE" (1969):  
The two small dippers vibrate on the surface of the water.

1066
01:03:51,350 --> 01:03:54,060
Each dipper produces its own pulse

1067
01:03:54,070 --> 01:03:58,120
and the two sets of patterns overlap.

1068
01:04:00,660 --> 01:04:03,480
Now the dippers are put out of step.

1069
01:04:03,480 --> 01:04:05,720
They are vibrating in anti-phase

1070
01:04:05,720 --> 01:04:08,220
and produce a different pattern.

1071
01:04:09,100 --> 01:04:12,480
In step, they produce a pattern like this.

1072
01:04:16,450 --> 01:04:19,620
Out of step, the pattern is like this.

1073
01:04:24,140 --> 01:04:26,600
DR. DANIEL KIM (December 27, 2019): 
This is kind of a complicated [slide] but

1074
01:04:26,600 --> 01:04:32,280
this is showing the degree to which the monthly ups and downs of Monero

1075
01:04:32,280 --> 01:04:35,180
versus the monthly ups and downs of Bitcoin

1076
01:04:35,180 --> 01:04:38,860
versus the monthly ups and downs of the US stock market,

1077
01:04:38,860 --> 01:04:41,960
the US bond market, and gold.

1078
01:04:43,060 --> 01:04:46,080
For example, this square here [second row, far left]

1079
01:04:46,080 --> 01:04:49,400
is showing the intersection of Monero and Bitcoin.

1080
01:04:49,400 --> 01:04:52,800
On this [horizontal] axis you see the Monero return,

1081
01:04:52,800 --> 01:04:55,480
on this [vertical] axis you see the Bitcoin return.

1082
01:04:55,480 --> 01:04:59,380
You can see that in months when Monero does well,

1083
01:04:59,380 --> 01:05:01,380
Bitcoin also tends to do well.

1084
01:05:01,380 --> 01:05:04,520
You have this kind of pattern, this correlation.

1085
01:05:05,300 --> 01:05:10,800
Here you can also see that there's some really extreme outlier months for Monero in the positive though.

1086
01:05:10,800 --> 01:05:16,220
This particular month, Monero basically quadrupled in one month.

1087
01:05:16,740 --> 01:05:18,200
This is part of owning crypto --

1088
01:05:18,200 --> 01:05:21,660
that you're on this really wild rollercoaster ride --

1089
01:05:21,660 --> 01:05:24,860
and you need to be able to deal with that.

1090
01:05:24,860 --> 01:05:26,400
But what this is showing is that

1091
01:05:26,400 --> 01:05:30,160
there is a correlation between the returns of Monero and Bitcoin.

1092
01:05:30,160 --> 01:05:31,500
That's a 0.4 correlation [top row, 2nd from left].

1093
01:05:31,500 --> 01:05:34,540
A 1.00 correlation is perfectly correlated --

1094
01:05:34,540 --> 01:05:36,340
they go up and down together.

1095
01:05:36,340 --> 01:05:40,420
Negative 1 is the opposite -- if one goes up, the other goes down.

1096
01:05:40,580 --> 01:05:42,480
In Modern Portfolio Theory --

1097
01:05:42,480 --> 01:05:46,380
and this is true for also your own personal portfolio, it's an idea to think about --

1098
01:05:46,380 --> 01:05:51,520
if you have two assets who you expect to do well in the future

1099
01:05:52,920 --> 01:05:55,680
and they're uncorrelated, in other words,

1100
01:05:55,680 --> 01:06:00,380
when one asset goes up the other is flat or maybe the other one goes down,

1101
01:06:00,380 --> 01:06:05,780
in other words, the ups and downs from day to day of these two different assets

1102
01:06:05,780 --> 01:06:07,900
tend to cancel each other out.

1103
01:06:07,900 --> 01:06:09,780
If you have that situation

1104
01:06:09,780 --> 01:06:13,440
then if you make a portfolio out of both of those assets

1105
01:06:13,440 --> 01:06:17,160
your combined volatility is going to be improved.

1106
01:06:17,160 --> 01:06:18,780
It's going to be reduced

1107
01:06:18,780 --> 01:06:23,860
because the components that you're adding are anti-correlated.

1108
01:06:24,520 --> 01:06:26,980
This is a very big deal for Wall Street investors

1109
01:06:27,040 --> 01:06:33,800
because it turns out correlation structure tends to be more dependable and long-lived

1110
01:06:33,800 --> 01:06:36,320
than predictions of outperformance, so

1111
01:06:36,320 --> 01:06:38,980
correlation structures tend to persist.

1112
01:06:39,860 --> 01:06:43,600
Wall Street is always looking for sources of uncorrelated alpha.

1113
01:06:43,880 --> 01:06:51,280
For example, if you look at the correlation of Monero with traditional assets like US stocks, we have 0.01 [top row, 4th from left].

1114
01:06:52,400 --> 01:06:55,100
An idea to think about is that

1115
01:06:55,100 --> 01:06:59,420
putting together assets that wiggle in different ways can be

1116
01:06:59,420 --> 01:07:02,260
a positive force for your overall portfolio.

1117
01:07:02,260 --> 01:07:05,540
Now again, as I mentioned, this is only talking about correlation structure, 

1118
01:07:05,540 --> 01:07:08,880
this is the ups and downs. This is not talking about

1119
01:07:08,880 --> 01:07:10,860
"is the price going to go up in the future" --

1120
01:07:10,860 --> 01:07:13,700
that's a different question.

1121
01:07:16,280 --> 01:07:18,580
So let me show this, and then I'll finish...

1122
01:07:18,580 --> 01:07:23,500
and I'm sorry, I'm going over [time]... but I guess there's no one after me...

1123
01:07:23,500 --> 01:07:25,840
but I'll try to make it quick.

1124
01:07:27,100 --> 01:07:32,160
I think what I'm showing here is pretty much the only asset price chart you need

1125
01:07:32,160 --> 01:07:34,320
and that is a very long term view.

1126
01:07:34,440 --> 01:07:39,360
This is showing from the beginning of cryptocurrency, 2009 to 2020.

1127
01:07:39,360 --> 01:07:41,040
This is 11 years of history

1128
01:07:41,040 --> 01:07:45,880
and you almost never see this in the crypto bloggers

1129
01:07:45,880 --> 01:07:48,140
or people on YouTube blabbing about crypto.

1130
01:07:48,140 --> 01:07:51,040
They're always focused on what happened yesterday.

1131
01:07:52,620 --> 01:07:55,000
It's totally a distraction

1132
01:07:55,000 --> 01:07:57,420
for anyone who has a long term view.

1133
01:07:58,460 --> 01:08:03,880
So, I would suggest whenever looking at crypto as an asset, to zoom out on the horizontal scale

1134
01:08:03,880 --> 01:08:06,180
and also zoom out on the vertical scale.

1135
01:08:06,700 --> 01:08:12,200
What I'm showing here:  each of these [y axis] divisions is a factor of 10.

1136
01:08:12,200 --> 01:08:16,640
Here we have 1 cent, 1 dollar and 10 thousand dollars.

1137
01:08:16,720 --> 01:08:24,420
This is an initial investment of one euro becoming 10 million euros, that's the scale.

1138
01:08:24,420 --> 01:08:26,220
And on this sort of scale,

1139
01:08:26,220 --> 01:08:28,760
all of these ups and downs

1140
01:08:28,760 --> 01:08:31,800
which seem big, disappear.

1141
01:08:31,800 --> 01:08:34,520
For example, let's look at the S&P 500,

1142
01:08:34,520 --> 01:08:36,400
the US stock market.

1143
01:08:36,400 --> 01:08:38,340
If you're involved at all in the stock market,

1144
01:08:38,340 --> 01:08:42,660
you know that December 2019 has been a very good month.

1145
01:08:42,660 --> 01:08:45,160
We're talking 15% up,

1146
01:08:45,160 --> 01:08:47,500
which is really big for the stock market.

1147
01:08:47,500 --> 01:08:52,900
But if you look on this scale, it's like a pixel.

1148
01:08:56,120 --> 01:08:59,480
I think this underlines the decision

1149
01:08:59,480 --> 01:09:04,380
that anyone has when thinking about cryptocurrency as a possible investment.

1150
01:09:04,380 --> 01:09:07,620
It's this baby. It's still a baby.

1151
01:09:07,620 --> 01:09:11,640
It's amazing because it's gone up orders of magnitude

1152
01:09:11,640 --> 01:09:16,020
and yet compared to other assets, it's still a baby.

1153
01:09:16,020 --> 01:09:17,700
This next chart shows that.

1154
01:09:17,700 --> 01:09:19,680
What I've done here is --

1155
01:09:19,680 --> 01:09:26,420
it's hard to understand, if somebody tells you that the price of Bitcoin is $7,000,

1156
01:09:26,420 --> 01:09:31,600
it's hard to know whether that's high or low. Who knows?

1157
01:09:35,260 --> 01:09:36,700
It's just really hard to know

1158
01:09:36,800 --> 01:09:39,060
because it's just one Bitcoin

1159
01:09:39,060 --> 01:09:41,060
and it's hard to put that in perspective.

1160
01:09:41,060 --> 01:09:43,060
What I've done here is I've taken the

1161
01:09:43,400 --> 01:09:47,280
value of all of the Bitcoin in existence.

1162
01:09:47,940 --> 01:09:52,540
Starting from the beginning of Bitcoin, as time goes on,

1163
01:09:52,540 --> 01:09:55,480
more Bitcoins got rewarded to miners

1164
01:09:55,480 --> 01:09:57,820
so there have been more Bitcoins in existence

1165
01:09:57,820 --> 01:10:00,380
and the price has been going up and down.

1166
01:10:00,380 --> 01:10:03,740
I multiplied the number of Bitcoins in existence by the [then-] current price

1167
01:10:03,740 --> 01:10:06,020
and that gives you the market cap.

1168
01:10:06,020 --> 01:10:08,900
What I've done with that is I've divided that

1169
01:10:08,900 --> 01:10:15,200
by the value of all of the gold, above ground, in the world.

1170
01:10:15,200 --> 01:10:18,780
All of the gold that has been already been dug out of the ground

1171
01:10:18,780 --> 01:10:21,380
and is sitting in vaults around the world

1172
01:10:21,380 --> 01:10:23,420
and owned mostly by central governments,

1173
01:10:23,420 --> 01:10:25,640
but also a good amount is in jewelry, and so on,

1174
01:10:25,640 --> 01:10:27,640
and there are estimates of this.

1175
01:10:28,020 --> 01:10:32,720
Basically, there are estimates for how much gold there is in the world at any given time

1176
01:10:32,720 --> 01:10:35,940
so I've divided the value of all the world's Bitcoin

1177
01:10:35,940 --> 01:10:38,360
divided by the value of all the world's gold.

1178
01:10:38,360 --> 01:10:41,460
And I've done that for 11 years.

1179
01:10:41,460 --> 01:10:43,520
What you can see here is that,

1180
01:10:43,520 --> 01:10:48,800
currently, the value of all the Bitcoin in the world is about 1% of that of all the gold.

1181
01:10:48,800 --> 01:10:53,040
In other words, all the gold is worth a hundred times what all the Bitcoin is worth.

1182
01:10:53,040 --> 01:10:55,740
And if you do that for Monero --

1183
01:10:55,740 --> 01:10:59,880
and, arguably, this analogy is even more apt for Monero,

1184
01:10:59,880 --> 01:11:03,940
because when you turn a bar of gold over,

1185
01:11:03,940 --> 01:11:07,160
you don't see a list of everyone who owned that bar of gold,

1186
01:11:07,160 --> 01:11:08,400
you just see gold --

1187
01:11:08,720 --> 01:11:11,800
so Monero acts more like actual gold than Bitcoin does,

1188
01:11:11,800 --> 01:11:15,760
therefore, it makes more sense to make a ratio of all the world's Monero,

1189
01:11:15,760 --> 01:11:16,940
how much is that worth, 

1190
01:11:16,940 --> 01:11:19,520
divided by how much all the world's gold is worth -- 

1191
01:11:19,520 --> 01:11:24,920
if you do that, we're looking at 1/100 of 1%.

1192
01:11:25,960 --> 01:11:32,200
That's what I mean when I say that this asset class is still a baby, it's still early.

1193
01:11:32,320 --> 01:11:36,480
Things could go well for it, things could go very wrong for it.

1194
01:11:36,620 --> 01:11:39,060
There could be a bug that nobody knows about.

1195
01:11:39,060 --> 01:11:41,960
There could be governmental action which a lot of people

1196
01:11:41,960 --> 01:11:43,320
I think overly worry about

1197
01:11:43,320 --> 01:11:49,460
because I think we geeks tend to think of governments as being like Reddit moderators

1198
01:11:49,460 --> 01:11:51,320
with ban power.

1199
01:11:51,320 --> 01:11:53,380
And that's not really how governments work,

1200
01:11:53,380 --> 01:11:55,380
it's a bit more deliberative --

1201
01:11:55,380 --> 01:11:59,380
and if an unjust ban happens, there are things like the Supreme Court

1202
01:11:59,380 --> 01:12:03,460
that might be asked to decide whether, for example,

1203
01:12:03,460 --> 01:12:09,120
Americans have a fundamental right to transact value in a private manner.

1204
01:12:09,120 --> 01:12:13,900
This could be a court case that comes up in the future

1205
01:12:14,480 --> 01:12:15,560
put forth by people

1206
01:12:15,560 --> 01:12:19,460
who really care about privacy as a fundamental human right.

1207
01:12:20,140 --> 01:12:23,290
I'll leave with that, and thanks for your attention.
