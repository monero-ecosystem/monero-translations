## The role of the Reviewer

**Reviewers** are people with **Review** rights on Weblate. Reviewers are members of the Monero Localization Workgroup who speak a second language and have been contributing to Monero enough to be trusted for this role. These contributors have a solid understanding of the workflow used by the workgroup and have given a substantial help in translating a language. The reviewer will have edit/approve/reject powers only for the language of their interest.

Reviewers are also added as members of the `monero-translations` repository.

### Guidelines

Reviewers **must** follow these guidelines:

- Do not bypass the reviewing system by directly submitting a translation (the 'Save') button. Every translation must be *suggested* and approved by another translator. If no other translator show up after a decent amount of time, reviewers can approve their own suggestions.
- This is a high trust role. Don't abuse your powers for subjective reason. Consider yourself as a neutral reviewer. Like a Jedi without cool mind tricks.
- You are one of the elements which assures the high quality of the translations. Remember to **always use as a reference the glossary and the translation memory when reviewing**.
- Reviewers should idle on `#monero-translations`.
- Reviewers should **watch** the `monero-translations` repository, to not miss updates and/or changes to the language they are reviewing.
- If you think a newly submitted translation is of lower quality than the one already present, you can revert it. If you think somebody is trying to abuse the reviewing system, signal them to @erciccione. So that the problem can be investigated and if necessary, the user banned.

### What can a reviewer do on Weblate?

Reviewers can and will:

- **Confirm translations** submitted by other contributors if they think they are of high quality and correctly follow the generic workgroup guidelines and language-specific guidelines (like making sure there is consistency between translations. Luckily, translation memories will help with this)
- **Edit translations**. Can happen that a translation is correctly made, but some checks fail because of missing or misplaced punctuaction. The reviewere has the possibility to fix these small issues and confirm the translation.
- **Reject or revert translations**. If a suggestion is google-translate like, doesn't follow the guidelines or it's of very bad quality. A reviewer can reject it without waiting for the votes of other contributors. If a translation has been accepted, they can rever it.
- **Add *screenshots of the context*.** Weblate gives the possibility to add screenshots to help translators with the context of the string they are working on. This feature is great but implement it requires a lot of time. Reviewers are free to add screenshots localized for the language they are **responsible** for if they want to.

Any contributor who has proved their knowledge of the workflow and has worked for long enough with the Localization Workgroup can ask to be a reviewer.
