## The role of the Reviewer

"Reviewers" are people with "Review" rights on Weblate. Reviewers are members of the Monero Localization Workgroup who speak a second language and have been around enough to be trusted for this role. These contributors have a solid understanding of the workflow used by the workgroup and have given a substantial help in translating a language. The reviewer will edit/approve/reject powers only for the language of their interest.

Reviewers are added as members of the `monero-translations` repository.

### Guidelines
Reviewers **must** follow these guidelines:

- Do not bypass the reviewing system by directly submitting a translation (the 'Save') button. Every translation must be *suggested* and approved by another translator. If no other translator show up after a decent amount of time, reviewers can approve their own suggestions.
- This is a high trust role. Don't abuse your powers for subjective reason. Consider yourself as a neutral reviewer. Like a Jedi without cool mind tricks.
- You are one of the elements which assures the high quality of the translations. Remember to **always use as a reference the glossary and the translation memory when reviewing**.
- Reviewers should idle on `#monero-translations`.
- Reviewers should "watch" the `monero-translations` repository, to not miss updates and/or changes to the language they are reviewing.
- If you think a newly submitted translation is of lower quality than the one already present, you can revert it. If you think somebody is trying to abuse the reviewing system, signal them to @erciccione. So that the problem can be investigated and if necessary, the user banned.

### What can a reviewer do on Weblate?
Reviewers can and will:

- **Confirm translations** submitted by other contributors if they think they are of high quality and correctly follow the generic workgroup guidelines and language-specific guidelines (like making sure there is consistency between translations. Luckily, translation memories will help with this)
- **Edit translations**. Can happen that a translation is correctly made, but some checks fail because of missing or misplaced punctuaction. The reviewere has the possibility to fix these small issues and confirm the translation.
- **Reject or revert translations**. If a suggestion is google-translate like, doesn't follow the guidelines or it's of very bad quality. A reviewer can reject it without waiting for the votes of other contributors. If a translation has been accepted, they can rever it.
- **Add "screenshots of the context"**. Weblate gives the possibility to add screenshots to help translators with the context of the string they are working on. This feature is great but implement it requires a lot of time. Reviewers are free to add screenshots localized for the language they are "responsible" for if they want to

Any contributor who has proved their knowledge of the workflow and has worked for long enough with the Localization Workgroup can ask to be a reviewer.
