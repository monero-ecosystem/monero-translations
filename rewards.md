Monero Core Team has agreed to provide the Monero Localization Workgroup with a small treasury, to be used to reward translators willing to review the work submitted by CCS-funded translators. The reviewers are personally contacted by the Translation Workgroup coordinator. *Details of payments will be posted here for transparency.*

These rewards are not meant to be payments for services, but token of appreciation for the work of a contributor made.

If you wish to donate to this fund to support the work of the Localization Workgroup, you can send Moneroj to this address:
