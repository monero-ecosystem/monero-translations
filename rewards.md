Core has agreed to provide the Monero Localization Workgroup with a small treasury, to be used to reward translators willing to review the work submitted by CCS-funded translators. The reviewers are personally contacted by ErCiccione. Details will be posted here for transparency.

These rewards are not meant to be payments for services, but token of appreciations for the work of a contributor.
